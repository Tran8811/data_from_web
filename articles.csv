Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/06/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action,"Duo keen to offer Anderson shelter Elliot Anderson spent much of Nottingham Forest’s 2-0 defeat on Tyneside reminding Eddie Howe how much he lost when Premier League spending rules demanded that the midfielder be sold to fend off the threat of a points deduction. That was back in the summer of 2024 and Anderson, now an England international, has rarely looked back since joining Forest. For much of the first half he eclipsed even Sandro Tonali and, overall, was comfortably Ange Postecoglou’s best player. Yet Anderson is human and when his loose pass offered Bruno Guimarães an opening, his subsequent attempt at a recovery tackle was mistimed and sent Guimarães crashing in the area. The Brazilian had already shot Newcastle ahead from 25 yards and from the spot Nick Woltemade scored his fourth goal in five starts. Tellingly, at the final whistle both Postecoglou and Howe made concerted efforts to console Anderson. If Forest’s manager is to survive and then thrive at Forest he will inevitably be heavily dependent on Anderson’s talent. Howe, meanwhile, would love to buy the Newcastle academy graduate back. Should Forest, with or without Postecoglou, continue to founder Newcastle may yet be in with a chance. Louise Taylor • Match report: Newcastle 2-0 Nottingham Forest More Rodri worries mar City win Rodri’s face told its own story. As he sank to the Brentford turf staring at his feet, there was a barely discernible shake of the head – though his body language spoke volumes. Another setback for the Spanish midfielder? It looked more than likely. Pep Guardiola has tried his best to manage Rodri’s game time this season since his tentative return from a serious knee injury; now he must put more faith in alternatives. Nico González is the most obvious replacement in City’s squad, yet has only been trusted to start one league game since 23 August. The former Porto man was a £49.8m signing in January and will be needed to step up more often after his 22nd-minute introduction for City in west London. On whether he can bring a measure of control akin to peak Rodri, the jury is still out. Dominic Booth • Match report: Brentford 0-1 Manchester City Mount climbs pecking order for United Injuries have hampered Mason Mount’s United career. His start against Sunderland was only his 17th in the league since joining in 2023 from Chelsea. His pedigree has never been questioned but finding a position and sufficient minutes to play himself into form, has proved problematic. On Saturday, his touch was impeccable and he brought creativity and discipline in equal measure, which might explain why Ruben Amorim selected him over Matheus Cunha. He took his goal superbly, scoring the quickest opener for Amorim’s team since his first game in charge 11 months ago. In an intense environment, Mount’s experience could prove vital. “I see myself as bringing a lot of energy into the team and setting off the press at times, being a bit of a catalyst going forward,” Mount said. “That’s always something that I focus on, helping the people around me and really bringing the energy. To get the goal was obviously massive for me.” Will Unwin • Match report: Manchester United 2-0 Sunderland Nuno puts faith in youngster Marshall Nuno Espírito Santo’s decision to bring on Callum Marshall for his debut at the Emirates against Arsenal, instead of the more experienced Callum Wilson, was an enormous show of faith in the 20-year-old Northern Ireland striker who spent last year on loan at Huddersfield. Given that Wilson – who joined on a free transfer in the summer – and Niclas Füllkrug have contributed just one goal between them so far in the Premier League, Marshall could get plenty of more opportunities if the new manager’s post-match assessment is anything to go by. “It’s not easy to put a young lad in front of Callum Wilson,” said Nuno. “It’s important for us, as soon as possible, to have total knowledge of who we have in the squad. What I’ve been seeing in training sessions, [Marshall] has energy, he’s a good finisher, good mobility, he can recognise the gaps in the space. I think we have something we can use.” Ed Aarons • Match report: Arsenal 2-0 West Ham Calm Frank slowly earns his Spurs Nobody seems quite sure how good Tottenham can be this season, least of all themselves. What is undeniable is that they are heading in the right direction under Thomas Frank. After a third win from four unbeaten away games this season, belief is growing that Spurs are developing into a far more cohesive and resilient outfit to the one which slumped to their worst Premier League finish under Ange Postecoglou last term. There is a calm assuredness to Frank, who spoke glowingly of his team’s mentality and collective desire in seeing off a pugnacious Leeds side at a raucous, windswept Elland Road. Frank had not beaten his Leeds counterpart and good friend Daniel Farke in five previous meetings in charge of Brentford and Norwich respectively, but goals from Mathys Tel and Mohammed Kudus, either side of Noah Okafor’s first-half equaliser, ensued the tables were turned. It is early days, but things are looking up for Spurs. Ross Heppenstall • Match report: Leeds 1-2 Tottenham Acheampong and Badiashile step up Enzo Maresca wanted a new centre-back after losing Levi Colwill to a knee injury before the start of the season. His bosses thought otherwise. Chelsea’s resources are deep and a panic buy was not required. Then came more injuries, leaving Maresca stretched. There were nerves about Josh Acheampong and Benoît Badiashile lining up against Liverpool on Saturday, but there need not have been. Acheampong is only 19 but few doubt his potential. The teenager dealt with Crystal Palace’s Jean-Philippe Mateta well on the opening weekend and he was assured again as Liverpool were beaten at Stamford Bridge, with Alexander Isak’s influence was dimmed by Chelsea’s fine defending. For Maresca, the only problem was Acheampong and Badiashile having to go off in the second half. Badiashile has only just returned from injury and it is hoped he was only suffering from cramp. The 24-year-old Frenchman has not always been convincing, but he appears to have stepped up a level since coming back into the starting lineup. Jacob Steinberg • Match report: Chelsea 2-1 Liverpool Glasner stays calm as Eagles finally dip To his credit, Oliver Glasner refused to blame fatigue as Crystal Palace’s proud 19-game unbeaten run came to an end four days after their Conference League exertions in Poland. “That would be a cheap excuse,” he said while attempting to come to terms with Everton’s unexpected late win at Hill Dickinson Stadium. Defeat to Jack Grealish’s first Everton goal was entirely self-inflicted, according to the Palace manager, with Jean Philippe-Mateta missing two clear chances to double the visitors’ advantage before Maxence Lacroix’s foul on Tim Iroegbunam offered David Moyes’s side a way back via the penalty spot. “We didn’t decide the game when we could have done and that has happened a few times now,” explained Glasner. “It is part of our development. We’ve made a few steps forward in the last few months and now we have to feel this pain and learn from it.” Andy Hunter • Match report: Everton 2-1 Crystal Palace Bogarde has Villa fans on their feet It is a staple of junior football and if there was a Most Improved Player prize at Aston Villa it would surely go to Lamare Bogarde. The 21-year-old, who signed from Feyenoord at 16, was given a standing ovation upon being substituted in the victory at home to Burnley, a week on from Unai Emery leading the applause when Bogarde was withdrawn late on in the win against Fulham. Emery admires Bogarde’s versatility but it was at the base of midfield where the Dutchman, who has started Villa’s past two league matches and featured in eight of Villa’s 10 games in all competitions, looks most at home. He was Villa’s most-fouled player against Burnley, a statistic indicative of his involvement, but perhaps more tellingly he completed 97% of his attempted passes (56 out of 58). Villa’s rise has meant academy youngsters have had few opportunities but Bogarde is proving increasingly instrumental. Ben Fisher • Match report: Aston Villa 2-1 Burnley Brighton’s note of curious caution Brighton remain the team to have received the most yellow cards in the Premier League this season after another four in the frustrating draw away at Wolves took them to 22. Manager Fabian Hürzeler was frustrated by the refereeing decisions. “I didn’t understand it,” he said. “Every first foul from us was a yellow card and in the hardest league in the world, that’s very frustrating.” He added that he was forced to substitute Carlos Baleba at half-time because of his midfielder’s caution. It’s not as if Brighton are overly aggressive or cynical is it? Peter Lansley • Match report: Wolves 1-1 Brighton Kluivert family make Patrick proud If the summer transfer market divested Bournemouth of a first-choice defence, Andoni Iraola retains much of his team’s attacking talent. Antoine Semenyo was the subject of serious interest but instead signed an extension to stay on until 2030. The match-winner in Friday’s late defeat of Fulham is in rare form, his two well-taken goals taking him to second in the Premier League scoring charts. “World class,” said fellow scorer Justin Kluivert on his colleague. “I want to try to keep him at this level, especially, confidence wise,” said Iraola of Semenyo. Kluivert had come off the bench to score a fine goal, completing a fine week for the Kluivert clan. On Wednesday, 18-year-old half-brother, Shane, scored for Barcelona in the Uefa Youth League against Paris Saint-Germain while his full brother, Ruben, scored for Lyon in the Europa League against Red Bull Salzburg on Thursday. Father Patrick shared his delight on social media as a “proud dad”. John Brewin • Match report: Bournemouth 3-1 Fulham"
Steven Gerrard in frame for Rangers return after Russell Martin is sacked,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/05/steven-gerrard-in-frame-rangers-return-russell-martin-sacked,"Steven Gerrard is under strong consideration for a return to Rangers after the Scottish club confirmed the sacking of Russell Martin. Martin’s ill-fated Ibrox tenure ended with the manager leaving the Falkirk Stadium via a side door and a waiting car after a 1-1 draw which left Rangers 11 points from the summit of Scotland’s top flight after just seven games. Furious fans had surrounded the Rangers team bus in Falkirk. The Rangers board had been reluctant to part with Martin, who was only hired in June, despite vociferous protests from supporters. However, there was an understanding the 39-year-old’s position became untenable. Rangers have won only one of their top-flight games to date, which has been combined with dismal performances in Europe. Overall, Martin won only five of 17 competitive matches with a passive, muddled brand of football that earned him few friends. “While all transition periods require some time, results have not met the club’s expectations,” said a Rangers statement on Sunday night. “Assistant head coach, Matt Gill, and first-team coach, Mike Williamson, will also be departing. Russell and his staff have worked exceptionally hard throughout their time at the club. We thank them for their efforts and wish them well for the future.” Gerrard won the title with Rangers in 2020-21, their only championship since 2011. His performance in Glasgow before then, coupled with struggles at Aston Villa, raises questions about his managerial capabilities. Yet he is held in high esteem by the very group of supporters Rangers desperately need back on side. The reappointment of the Liverpool icon, who last managed in Saudi Arabia, would prove hugely popular. Gerrard will also be aware of what few options he has to be a manager in significant leagues. Martin’s exit will intensify scrutiny on Kevin Thelwell, the Rangers sporting director. He had been hugely supportive of the manager while publicly revealing a net spend of £20m in the summer window. Martin had signed a three-year contract. Martin, who had previously been in charge of MK Dons and Swansea, managed Southampton to promotion to the Premier League in 2024 after being appointed the previous summer. He was sacked last December after the Saints won only one of their first 16 games. He was named Barry Ferguson’s successor in June, after the interim head coach had succeeded the sacked Philippe Clement in February. Danny Röhl, the former Sheffield Wednesday manager, and Sean Dyche, most recently in charge of Everton, are among others who are likely to enter the frame for the Rangers hotseat. In Sunday’s match, Rangers took the lead when Bojan Miovski slid the ball in from close range shortly before half-time, but the chants against the manager continued and increased in volume when John McGlynn’s Falkirk levelled spectacularly in the 73rd minute, Henry Cartwright curling in a vicious right-footed drive from 25 yards."
Guardiola hails ‘incredible’ Haaland and Donnarumma after City’s win at Brentford,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/05/guardiola-hails-donnarumma-and-haaland-after-man-city-win-at-brentford,"Pep Guardiola was thankful his Manchester City team has Erling Haaland scoring goals and Gianluigi Donnarumma stopping them after victory at Brentford came at the cost of another Rodri injury. “I have an incredible striker and keeper,” Guardiola said, the Norwegian’s ninth-minute goal proving the winner. Haaland’s form is reaching the levels of City’s 2022-23 treble season, the No 9 scoring in a ninth consecutive game. “He’s the best,” said his manager. “The year of the treble, he scored – what? – 50 million goals? I think he’s part of the club now, he’s settled. He feels now that it’s mine.” On Donnarumma’s crucial save from Igor Thiago, Guardiola said: “This guy starts to play at the highest level at 17. When they told me he’s 26 it’s like he’s had centuries playing football. His composure, his presence. With clubs who play good you get one piece of action and he did it today. One against one.” Guardiola passed the personal milestone of 250 Premier League wins, surpassing Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsène Wenger in reaching that total in a record 349 matches. “I will invite them to a good dinner, maybe not in Manchester, somewhere sunnier,” he said of those legendary managers. “Or in Manchester. It’s an honour and a pleasure to be part of Premier League history. I say thank you to the club and the players and the staff I had. We did it quicker and faster. Now let’s go to 250 games more.” On Rodri’s hamstring issue, the latest setback after a cruciate knee injury last season, Guardiola said: “I would love to have Rodri every three days but after one year it happens all the time, it is so demanding. That is why we tried to be gentle, play for 60-65 minutes but it cannot happen more.” Keith Andrews, Brentford’s manager, was pleased his team improved after City’s first-half dominance to threaten until the full-time whistle. “What we’re trying to do is bring a team together, a club together, after so many changes,” he said. “I think it’s growing. I think you could see that in the second half performance today against top-level opposition.”"
Arsenal confirm Martin Ødegaard has medial collateral ligament damage,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/05/arsenal-confirm-martin-degaard-has-medial-collateral-ligament-damage,"Arsenal have confirmed that Martin Ødegaard has withdrawn from Norway’s squad for their games against Israel and New Zealand after sustaining a medial collateral ligament injury to his left knee in the 2-0 win over West Ham on Saturday. Ødegaard went down clutching his knee after clashing with Crysencio Summerville in the first half at the Emirates and twice attempted to carry on after receiving treatment before being replaced by Martín Zubimendi. Mikel Arteta said after the match that Ødegaard had left the ground with his knee in a brace and the Arsenal manager admitted his captain was “not positive about it”. But while Declan Rice is expected to meet up with Thomas Tuchel’s England squad this week despite also being substituted against West Ham with a back problem, Arsenal confirmed on Sunday that Ødegaard had withdrawn from the Norway squad and it is understood they are hopeful that he will only be out for weeks rather than months. “Martin will continue to be assessed and treated by our medical team during the international window, with the aim of a return to action as soon as possible,” Arsenal said in a statement. Ødegaard has endured an injury-hit start to the new campaign after struggling with a shoulder injury that forced him off against Leeds and Nottingham Forest. He will join Gabriel Jesus, Kai Havertz and Noni Madueke on the sidelines, while the new signing Piero Hincapié is expected to return from a groin injury after the international break."
Postecoglou enters talks intent on keeping job at Nottingham Forest,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/05/postecoglou-enters-talks-intent-on-keeping-job-at-nottingham-forest,"Ange Postecoglou is determined to convince Nottingham Forest’s board to retain faith in his managerial philosophy when he holds talks with the club’s owner, Evangelos Marinakis, this week. The Australian was in defiant, almost jocular form after Sunday’s 2-0 defeat at Newcastle. It extended the manager’s winless run to seven games since he succeeded Nuno Espírito Santo last month. Yet Postecoglou, who unusually started with a back five, detected signs of progress as he prepared for vital talks with directors to discuss the future. “Yes, it’s a lost cause,” he said, sarcastically. “I see it as an exciting opportunity. You have to be up for the fight and the struggle. I’d be silly to be sitting here at the age of 60 if I lacked self-belief or fight. Even in the schoolyard I picked fights with people that beat me up.” Warming to his theme, Postecoglou gently mocked the pantomime of Premier League football that almost demands that at least one manager is always deemed under pressure. “I get that it’s part of the fanfare of the Premier League that it needs one manager to be in the spotlight. If people want to assess me three and a half weeks into the job, there’s nothing I can say or do that will change that. “But what I have seen and felt in this period is that we are heading in the direction I want us to. The results will come. In the meantime it is a struggle and a fight and there is nothing wrong with that. We don’t have things handed to us on a plate in life, we have to fight. I have fought for things all my life. Why does everyone want everything neatly packaged? The attitude today seems to be that as soon as something goes wrong, you change it.” Amid much hilarity, he suggested that one reporter might have been “a lost cause at some point but your parents didn’t give up on you”. Postecoglou then reiterated that he had walked into the City Ground with his eyes wide open and always understood that his attempt to alter Forest’s playing style would not be straightforward. “I knew this was a big challenge,” he said. “There’s nothing wrong with that. I don’t know why people think challenges are a burden, I love a challenge. The alternative is sitting at home watching games and I don’t want to do that. If you guys have a lot fun around it I don’t care. I couldn’t care less.”"
Brentford 0-1 Manchester City: Premier League – as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/oct/05/brentford-v-manchester-city-premier-league-live,"That’s all from me today. Check out John Brewin’s match report. With the way Liverpool are playing, Haaland may score at Anfield this season to complete the set. Three points for Manchester City. Erling Haaland 1-0 Brentford. After a dominant first half display, City trudged towards an important win. Thiago had the only real clear cut chance for Brentford in a drab second half. Guardiola’s 250th Premier League win was an ugly one. 90+2 min: Fábio Carvalho is on for Kristoffer Ajer. Will he produce some late drama? 90+1 min: Aaron Hickey wins the ball on the edge of the area and smashes the ball way over the bar. 90 min: There will be four minutes of additional time. 88 min: Are Manchester City comfortable enough to seeing this one out? Donnarumma tries to clear the ball but Schade closes him down and forces a corner. Brentford have a chance. 85 min: O’Reilly throws the ball forward towards Haaland in the box. The Norwegian tries to hold off van den Berg, but the defender has learned from the goal and shepherds the ball out of play. 80 min: There’s a lull as we head into the closing stages of the game. Manchester City are no longer cruising but Brentford having struggled to create many clear cut opportunities. Will Thiago rue that miss earlier in the half? 75 min: Bobb and Reijnders make way for Jérémy Doku and Bernardo Silva. 71 min: Yehor Yarmoliuk has gone down with an injury. Frank Onyeka comes on, along with Vitaly Janelt who replaces Henderson. 68 min: Henderson is imposing himself on this game. This time he goes careering into Phil Foden and receives a yellow card for his troubles. A bit more quality and Brentford could be back in the game. 66 min: Thiago makes way for Dango Ouattara. Mathias Jensen is on for Mikkel Damsgaard. 64 min: Haaland receives the ball outside of the box tries to turn provider. He edges towards the box and tries to pass the ball to Foden but it’s too close to Kelleher. Tim Stappard is a fed up City fan: “Messing around as usual. They don’t seem to learn. Even from a few days ago. Ridiculous.” Brentford have come out a different team in the second half. 58 min: It’s Henderson again. He plays a delicious through ball into the path of Thiago but it’s slightly out of the striker’s reach. 55 min: Jordan Henderson misplaces a pass to his teammate. In true Hendo fashion, the midfielder chases his own pass before closing Donnarumma down. He’s unable to win it back but his huffing and puffing earns a cheer from the home fans. 54 min: Sensing Brentford growing into the game, Manchester City take the sting out of it by keeping the ball. 47 min: Huge chance for Thiago! Brentford play a long ball over the top and over O’Reilly’s head. Thiago is through on goal and staring Gianluigi Donnarumma down. The Manchester City keeper makes himself big and the striker hits the ball straight at him. That finish was a far cry from his screamer against Manchester United. 46 min: Keith Andrews has opted against making any substitutions after a dismal first half. He did send the team out slightly early though. Manchester City get us going again. A message from Nick Kennedy: “Kevin Schade getting a yellow himself for urging the ref to brandish one at the close of the first half, pure, ahem schadenfreude for poor sportsmanship.” That was probably the funniest moment of the first half. Thank you for reminding me. Here’s a message from Allan Castle: “Hi Xaymaca. Was that not the most Haaland of goals? Hanging on the shoulder of the defender, winning possession through a combination of sheer strength and clever positioning, holding two opponents off with his power, using his pace to get free, and then a complete rocket of a shot. As much as (for example) I want Gyökeres to come good for Arsenal once he finds his range, I look at that finish and have to say Haaland will always be on another planet.” I agree with you. That’s got to be one of the most comfortable first halves you’re going to see in the Premier League. Manchester City are in cruise control while Brentford haven’t registered a shot on target. 44 min: Brentford haven’t had a sniff in this first half. Manchester City will be disappointed that it’s only 1-0. We’ve got an answer to Jeremy’s question from Kári Tulinius: “Foden fractured two fingers during the season before last, and from what I gather it’s never fully healed. Benzema had a similar injury and he would’ve needed a surgery to reset the bones, but he decided to just play bandaged as the recovery from the operation would’ve meant being sidelined for months. I don’t know if Foden made the same decision.” Ta very much. 38 min: What a save! Manchester City work it well again, this time down the left. Nico O’Reilly crosses the ball deep into the box for Reijnders to meets it on the full with a volley. Kelleher makes a smart reaction save. 34 min: Bobb has been excellent so far. He’s been involved in many of Manchester City’s best moves. 30 min: Reijnders plays a magnificent through ball to Bobb. The winger races away from the Brentford defenders before pulling the ball back for Foden. He decides to shoot with his unfavoured right foot and it’s well wide of the post. A question from Jeremy: “Grealish earlier, and now Foden and Haaland seem all to be back to something like their best this season. Does anyone know what is the story with Foden’s permanently bandaged middle fingers on his right hand?” I’m not sure. I’ll leave the readers to answer this question. 26 min: Bobb finds Foden with a firm pass into the middle. The midfielder, always on the half turn, drives forward and takes aim. His shot is deflected and harmlessly lands in Kelleher’s arms. 23 min: Brentford have struggled to make their mark on this game so far. Igor Thiago has only had three touches of the ball. 19 min: Rodri is down with an injury. After such a long time out with an anterior cruciate ligament injury, he looks completely crestfallen. Nico González comes on to replace him. 18 min: Manchester City are strutting their stuff. First, Matheus Nunes ghosts past his defender before playing the ball to Oscar Bobb on the right. Bobb fires the ball into Tijjani Reijnders, who lays it off for Phil Foden to strike first-time. It’s a comfortable save for Kelleher. 15 min: Phil Foden picks up the ball in space and slips it through to Haaland. The striker runs into the box and cuts it back but it’s cleared away by a Brentford defender. Warning signs for Brentford. He’s done it! Manchester City clip a ball over the top to Haaland. Playing on the shoulder of the last defender, Haaland pins Sepp van den Berg before shrugging him off. He takes a moment to adjust, get the ball out of his feet and fire past Caoimhin Kelleher. A classic striker’s goal. 4 min: Haaland drops to the edge of the area to link up play for Manchester City. His ability to help his teammates out in the build up seems much improved this season. 3 min: Manchester City are trying to set the tempo early in this game. So far Brentford seem content to hit it long on the counter. Brentford get us going. They’re kicking from right to left. The two teams are out on the pitch. They’re observing a minute’s silence for the victims of the recent attack at a Manchester synagogue. Here’s a message from Mary: “Xaymaca, greetings from California. The world is going to shite. I should be despondent. But Everton is seventh in the table and I can’t wipe the smile off my face. Shallow escapism? Yes. So be it.” Be sure to check out Andy Hunter’s Everton v Crystal Palace match report. Jordan Henderson has earned a place in Thomas Tuchel’s England squad again as we head into the international break. It’s a decision that would have raised eyebrows a couple of months but seems entirely justified based on the midfielder’s recent form. Hendo’s defence splitting through ball for Igor Thiago last week was a thing of beauty. His counterpart Phil Foden misses out despite his rich vein of form. Pep Guardiola said: “If he [Foden] keeps on playing like he is, then he will be back [in the England squad].” He’s scored six goals in three games against Brentford at the Gtech Stadium. Meanwhile, the Manchester City manager himself said of their first few games of the season: “The improvement can be better, reading what the opponent does, spaces to attack, the feeling we’re creating again, the tempo and pace that’s really good and attack more fluid and more consistently, we can do some movements that we can do better, and I love that.” On the eve of a potentially historic result for Pep Guardiola, the Brentford manager Keith Andrews reflected on the Manchester City manager’s legacy: “He’s probably been the best manager of the last 15 years, in the modern era; the way he’s coached the game, the way he’s changed the way the game is perceived and played at different clubs and in different countries.” Brentford: Kelleher, Collins, van den Berg, Ajer, Kayode, Damsgaard, Henderson, Yarmoliuk, Hickey, Schade, Thiago Subs: Carvalho, Henry, Janelt, Jensen, Lewis-Potter, Onyeka, Ouattara, Pinnock, Valdimarsson Manchester City: Donnarumma, Nunes, Dias, Gvardiol, O’Reilly, Rodri, Savinho, Reijnders, Foden, Bobb, Haaland Subs: Aké, Cherki, Doku, González, Kovačić, Lewis, Silva, Stones, Trafford Hello and welcome to minute-by-minute coverage of this Premier League game between Brentford and Manchester City at the Gtech Stadium. Today’s match is the battle of the No 9s. In the red corner is Igor Thiago. Up until Antoine Semenyo’s heroics against Fulham on Friday, the Brazilian was the joint-second highest scorer in the league with four goals in six games. He’s remarkably efficient with a 40% goal conversion rate, as his first goal against Manchester United highlighted. In the blue corner is Erling Haaland. The Norwegian has been Manchester City’s brightest spark this season. He’s scored 17 goals in 10 games for club and country and is once again doing Haaland things. He’s never scored at the Gtech before though so he’ll be keen to break his duck. A win for Keith Andrew’s side would make it back to back wins against the two Manchester teams. For Pep Guardiola, today is a chance to record a 250th Premier League win as Manchester City manager. A win would make him the fastest manager to achieve such a feat with one Premier League club. Kick off is at 4:30pm. Send me your questions and comments via email."

Erling Haaland powers Brentford aside as Manchester City show new promise,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/05/brentford-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report,"A 250th Premier League win for Pep Guardiola, achieved at record speed, and, in a season where no contender is perfect, a seventh title trophy cannot be ruled out. The Manchester City of autumn 2025 are a work in progress, low on previous star quality but still full of possibilities. The presence of Erling Haaland, in devastating form, is a cast-iron guarantee they will be sticking around for a while yet. In the ninth minute Haaland scored his ninth Premier League goal of the season, notching for the ninth game in succession. Played in by Josko Gvardiol, Haaland’s unmatchable power and speed completed the job, bustling through Sepp van den Berg and Nathan Collins to clatter past Caoimhín Kelleher. At 25, as a young father, handed a leadership role by his manager, Haaland is thriving under added responsibility. “I have never felt better than I do now,” he said. “It is about preparation, getting ready for the games. You can be physically ready but you need to be mentally ready. With a kid it makes me even better because I disconnect more than ever – I don’t think about football at all.” City fans singing for Kevin De Bruyne reminded Haaland is no longer supported by proven winners, much of the star system that once surrounded him now passed into club legend. The new City are full of promise, but where their Premier League peers have bought finished products, to currently mixed results, the Etihad project turns towards potential. Three points ground out at Brentford saw first-half dominance followed by a far more tentative second half. Brentford fought back determinedly but suffered for a lack of quality when opportunities arose. Keith Andrews was denied in his quest to beat Manchester United and Manchester City in consecutive games, the last manager to do so being Tottenham’s Gerry Francis in 1996. In City’s 2022-23 treble-winning season, only Thomas Frank’s Brentford’s did a league double over them. Matching those historic feats proved beyond reach with Haaland around. “I am not sure how many centre-forwards in world football score that goal,” Andrews said. The Irishman’s technical area vigil was anguished, the key moments never quite coming off, despite endeavours that made life uncomfortable for City until the closing moments. By the conclusion, Guardiola was a more frantic presence on the touchline. This City team do not yet kill off opponents as was habitual in the imperial phase of the recent past. The skill level remains elite but prey is not battered into submission. “Many things I like,” Guardiola said. “I know there are things we can do better but they made a fantastic first half, one of the best in many months.” Collins, Brentford’s captain, said: “They were getting too close to our box, in and around it. In the second half we were a bit more aggressive on the press, got higher up, pressed them higher.” City assumed grip from the first whistle, Igor Thiago and Kevin Schade feeding off meagre scraps. Bees fans’ greatest thrills in the first half came when Gianluigi Donnarumma was asked to play the ball but the goalkeeper made no mistakes, to audible disappointment. For City, Jérémy Doku, in fine form, was a notable omission, the latest victim of a Guardiola tombola team selection in his continuing search for a formula. Rodri in midfield after playing in Monaco was supposed to be a mark of progress in recovery from his knee injury, only for him to depart with a hamstring injury, rubbing his right haunch in disappointment. Phil Foden, omitted by Thomas Tuchel, had two first-half efforts created by Bobb, City’s other Norwegian showing off a talent flourishing since his own return from long-term injury. Foden was central to City’s first-half control, only to fade when the going got tougher. An instinctive save from Kelleher denied Tijjani Reijnders’ volley; City should have been further ahead at half-time than 1-0. That only Haaland has scored more than a single Premier League goal suggests someone else needs to step up soon. The second half arrived with Andrews and Brentford appearing well ahead of City. Michael Kayode’s early surge down the right flank brought fresh impetus. A golden chance was missed – and saved – when Gvardiol’s missed header set up Igor Thiago for a one-on-one. An onrushing Donnarumma prevailed. Kayode’s header wide soon after suggested City’s failure to kill the game might have consequences. “The second half was our half,” said Andrews. Haaland was now being asked to defend Kayode’s long throws, as a second-row lock forward in a lineout formation protecting Donnarumma. Haaland said: “It reminded me of Stoke City with Rory Delap 15 years ago. They are huge and do throw-ins from the middle so of course it is not easy but it is about preparing for what is going to come.” Stoppage time featured Haaland and Guardiola directing their team’s play together, manager and star player in tandem as victory was seen out. They will need each other for the challenges ahead."
"Newcastle 2-0 Nottingham Forest, Everton 2-1 Crystal Palace and more: Premier League clockwatch – as it happened",https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/oct/05/newcastle-nottingham-forest-everton-crystal-palace-premier-league-clockwatch-live,"That’s all for today’s multiclocko. Thanks for your company, and please join Xaymaca Awoyungbo for the upcoming game between Brentford and Manchester City. Bye! I have the manager to thank. He said to me at half-time, ‘Try to get in at the back post’. It’s so nice to score here. The last few games here we’ve been drawing, and I keep saying to myself around the 85th minute, ‘Come on Jack, try and score. Imagine if you scored now!’ That goal goes to all the Evertonians who have made me so welcome here. It’s a struggle, it’s a fight. I could be sitting on the couch but I prefer to be in the middle of it where I can make an impact, and I believe I will. Jack Grealish: an apology “My first reaction to Grealish’s goal was the same as yours, that it was pure dumb luck,” writes Kári Tulinius. “However, having seen the replay, it seems like he saw what Muñoz was about to do and put his foot deliberately in the way. Instinctive and smart.” I didn’t have chance to look at a replay when it happened, but I have now… and you’re right! Grealish reads Munoz’s body shape and throws his left leg forward; had he not done so he wouldn’t have scored. Two excellent goals form Donyell Malen have secured a fourth win in a row for Villa, whose false start to the season is a thing of the past. Crystal Palace have fallen at the 20th hurdle. Jack Grealish’s injury-time goal completed a rousing Everton comeback at Hill Dickinson Stadium – and ended Palace’s 19-game unbeaten run. Everton jump to seventh in the table, a point behind Chelsea and Palace above them. 90+9 min: Aston Villa 2-1 Burnley Buendia is on his feet now and is able to walk off the field to be replaced by Ian Maatsen; I think that’s a concussion substitute. No word on any punishment for Flemming. Wolves are still waiting for their first Premier League win after a late equaliser from Jan Paul Van Hecke. 90+7 min: Aston Villa 2-1 Burnley Buendia is still receiving treatment, which is more than a little worrying. He’s been down for six minutes. There’s only a thumbnail picture on the TV but it looks like a stretcher has been brought onto the field. An ultimately comfortable win for Newcastle. Bruno Guimaraes’s superb goal was followed by a late penalty from Nick Woltemade to increase the absurd pressure on Ange Postecoglou. 90+5 min: Aston Villa 2-1 Burnley Zian Flemming could be in trouble after apparently flooring Villa’s Emi Buendia with an elbow. Crystal Palace’s long unbeaten run is surely coming to an end. Beto’s towering header was stopped superbly by Dean Henderson, with the ball running loose in front of goal. Daniel Munoz tried to boot the ball somewhere, anywhere, but it hit Grealish and ricocheted into the net. Lucky or not, that’s a lovely moment for Grealish, a footballer reborn at Hill Dickinson Stadium. Jack Grealish has brought the house down with one of the worst goals of his career! 90 min: Aston Villa 2-1 Burnley Martin Dubravka, who has had a busy afternoon, leaps to his left to keep out Lucas Digne’s shot. Excellent save. Premier League latest scores Aston Villa 2-1 Burnley Everton 1-1 Crystal Palace Newcastle 2-0 Nottm Forest Wolves 1-1 Brighton “In 2001, Five Guys consisted of five hamburger places in the DC metro area,” says Beau Dure. “They now have 1,900 locations worldwide. The first one in the UK opened in London in 2013, a few years before I was last there. The burgers are good, but at least in the locations near me, a “small” order of fries requires a fork lift to move to your table. Brighton are level at Molineux. A left-wing corner is taken short to Maxim De Cuyper, whose first-time cross is headed powerfully into the net by Jan Paul Van Hecke. A goal made in the Low Countries. 85 min: Newcastle 2-0 Nottm Forest “Somewhere in a tastefully and efficiently furnished officed in Bavaria,” begins Chris Paraskevas, “a Bayern Munich legend is whipping up a very snarky press statement.” Nick Woltemade sweeps a superb, almost nonchalant penalty into the top-left corner. Newcastle are getting a decent return on their idiocy. 82 min: Newcastle 1-0 Nottm Forest Matz Sels is about to be called upon again. Elliot Anderson doesn’t see Bruno Guimaraes coming on his blind side, then lunges desperately for the ball and trips Guimaraes. A clear penalty. Premier League latest Aston Villa 2-1 Burnley Everton 1-1 Crystal Palace Newcastle 1-0 Nottm Forest Wolves 1-0 Brighton 80 min: Newcastle 1-0 Nottm Forest Matz Sels keeps Forest in the game with two superb saves to deny first Malick Thiaw and then Harvey Barnes. Burnley have hope at Villa Park. Lesley Ugochukwu, weirdly unmarked at corner, beats Emi Martinez with a downward header from six yards. An update from James Humphries (see 3.31pm) Someone should take this effing phone off me, it’s clearly in the wrong hands. “What a difference a season makes for Forest,” weeps Martin Widdicks. “It probably makes me a fair weather fan but I’m filling this game purely through your MBM after the largely torturous Sunderland and Midtjylland games. “Looks to be following a similar pattern that Forest are doing ok but can no longer get that all important first goal and huff and puff to a 1- or 2-0 defeat. The spark around the club seems to have really gone. It’s sad.” Not this time. Iliman Ndiaye strokes the penalty to his left, with Henderson going the wrong way. Coolly done. 74 min: Everton 0-1 Crystal Palace A silly – and slightly odd - foul by Maxence Lacroix on Tim Iroegbunam gives Everton the chance to equalise. But Dean Henderson is a world-class penalty-saver. 73 min: Newcastle 1-0 Nottm Forest Matz Sels leaps to flap Tonali’s mishit volleyed cross over the bar, an excellent save. The resulting corner bounces down and is flashed off the underside of the bar by Woltemade. “Worth noting (well, maybe not, but I’m going to anyway) that today is skipper Paul McGinn’s hundredth appearance for Motherwell,” writes James Humphries. “He’s been injury-plagued the last couple seasons and he’s not flashy, but I think he’s underrated as an organiser and defensive rhythm-setter, and my sincere hope is that he brings his calm to a defence that has been... not quite as convincing as the attack and will need to be in rare form. “Comparing him and John is proper big brother/wee brother vibes; the elder mcginn has a constantly slightly harassed look about him that I don’t think is entirely caused by being responsible for a, let’s say risk-taking, backline. On yerself, Paul!” Approximately 0.0004 seconds after James sent that email, Kelechi Iheanacho’s penalty gave Celtic the lead against Motherwell. Not that Paul McGinn was culpable. Not directly. “Anyone out there, you ask?” writes Beau Dure. “Yes, I’m enjoying the cultural whiplash of reading about Premier League games while watching the NFL play a terrible game in Spurs’ stadium. I think I’ll continue the day by watching the US film with the Eighth Doctor and planning to visit the Five Guys location in London.” There’s a Five Guys museum? Premier League latest Aston Villa 2-0 Burnley Everton 0-1 Crystal Palace Newcastle 1-0 Nottm Forest Wolves 1-0 Brighton 68 min: Everton 0-1 Crystal Palace A fierce rising drive from the Everton substitute Carlos Alcaraz is tipped over by the leaping Dean Henderson. It’s his job, but he did it well. “Since you asked, I’m out there – bit sad to be missing the Palace game as picking up my daughter from gymnastics but seems we’re playing well,” writes Dennis Hamer. “I have a simple question: in the age of the £20m squad player at mid-table teams, is Dani Muñoz the best value player in the Premier League? £8m for that engine, skill, sense of timing and cult appeal that he’d have even if he were rubbish?” He’s a joy, isn’t he, a bullet train with brains. September’s crisis club Aston Villa are heading for their fourth straight win. Morgan Rogers guides a precise angled pass into the path of Donyell Malen, who takes a touch and blisters a shot across Martin Dubravka. Two goals for him, both superbly taken. 64 min: Everton 0-1 Crystal Palace For once Jean-Philippe Mateta isn’t smiling. He’s just missed a terrific chance, dragging wide of the near post with Jordan Pickford out of the game. There was a defender between him and the goal but it was still a brilliant opportunity. “Got up at 6am here in British Columbia,” writes Brian Robson, “but nothing much to keep awake to until Bruno’s strike.” It was a lovely goal. He was 25 yards out yet he made the finish look almost routine. 61 min: Newcastle 1-0 Nottm Forest Chris Wood misses an excellent chance for Forest, though he was offside so it wouldn’t have counted. 58 min: Wolves 1-0 Brighton Sam Johnstone adds to his portfolio of remarkable reaction saves, changing direction sharply to tip Yankuba Minteh’s shot past the post. That’s a seriously good stop. Bruno Guimaraes gives Newcastle the lead with a beautiful goal, whipped across Matz Sels from 25 yards. Forest are appealing for a foul on Morgan Gibbs-White in the build-up but it looked like Guimaraes won the ball fairly. Yep, the goal has been given. 56 min: Aston Villa 1-0 Burnley Fine goalkeeping from Burnley’s Martin Dubravka, who flies from his line to block Morgan Rogers’ shot. 55 min: Wolves 1-0 Brighton Jhon Arias punches the ground repeatedly after sidefooting over the bar from 10 yards. That was a glorious chance to double Wolves’ lead. Premier League latest Aston Villa 1-0 Burnley Everton 0-1 Crystal Palace Newcastle 0-0 Nottm Forest Wolves 1-0 Brighton 50 min: Newcastle 0-0 Nottm Forest Morato makes a horrible mess of Gordon’s cross, miscontrolling it in front of his own goal, but redeems himself with an outstanding block from Nick Woltemade’s goalbound volley. “Afternoon Rob,” writes Simon McMahon. “There are three games in Scotland today, with crisis club Rangers visiting Falkirk, crisis club Celtic hosting Motherwell and crisis club Aberdeen up against Dundee. The Dons will remain bottom whatever happens today, Celtic could close the gap between them and early pacesetters Hearts to two points with a win, while Rangers could conceivably end up anywhere from third to tenth come full time. The Ibrox faithful are well known for their patience so I’m sure they’ll be happy to give Russell Martin as much time as is needed to secure that all important top six finish.” We need more than one Crisis Baton™, don’t we, to satisfy the hysteria of modern football. Get me a thousand! Mass produce the buggers! 46 min Peep peep! The second halves are under way. “Yeremy Pino has been brilliant today, and Daichi Kamada has been great behind him as well,” writes Kári Tulinius. “I think he’s one of the most underrated midfielders in the Premier League. He played as a No10 when Frankfurt won the Europa League, and he’s slotted seamlessly into a deeper-lying role at Palace, constantly breaking up opposition play and setting up attacking moves. If Palace are in the top four at the end of the season, he’ll be a big reason why.” It’s interesting that Palace have two ball-playing central midfielders in their 3-4-2-1. I know they can defend as well but it’s quite rare to see that, even with three centre-backs behind them. Everton 0-1 Crystal Palace “It’s a long time since I’ve seen a half like that one from Yeremy Pino,” writes Gary Naylor, as two-eyed as ever. Eberechi Eze and Michael Olise were irreplaceable, individually and as a pair, but to get Pino and Ismaila Sarr for a combined £35m is exceptional business. Moneyball porn. So far so good for Ange Postecoglou, whose team have defended solidly at St James’ Park. Matz Sels made one very good save to keep out Joelinton’s header but the stormy forecast has yet to materalise. A strong first-half performance from Villa, who are ahead thanks to a classy finish from Donyell Malen. Wolves lead thanks to a desperately unfortunate own goal from Brighton keeper Bart Verbruggen. It was missed by Wolves boss Vitor Pereira, who was on his way to the stands after being sent off. The brilliant Daniel Munoz – arguably the Premier League’s best right-back – has given Crystal Palace the lead at Hill Dickinson Stadium. 45 min: Newcastle 0-0 Nottm Forest A bit of a flare up at St James’ Park, though it’s not clear why. The referee calms everything down quickly enough. 41 min: Everton 0-1 Crystal Palace That Munoz goal stemmed from a superb turn by Yeremy Pino, who looks such a bargain at £21.6m. Palace’s attacking square – the two central midfielders and the two No10s – really is full of class: Kamada, Wharton, Pino and Sarr. And between them they cost barely £50m. 40 min: Aston Villa 1-0 Burnley Villa have a big penalty appeal turned down. Morgan Rogers tried to run onto a return pass from John McGinn and went over after a slight tug of shirt from Axel Tuanzebe. The referee, and Team VAR, decided there wasn’t enough contact for a penalty. The bullet train gives Crystal Palace the lead at Hill Dickinson Stadium! Yeremy Pino and Ismaila Sarr combined superbly to release the tireless Daniel Munoz, who slid the ball under Pickford from the angle. 36 min: Aston Villa 1-0 Burnley I think a Burnley corner just swirled onto the top of the crossbar, though I’m not 100 per cent sure because there are four games going on at the same time! 35 min: Aston Villa 1-0 Burnley A long throw for Burnley is half cleared towards Josh Cullen on the edge of the area. He cracks a low shot that is fingertipped round the post by the diving Martinez. That’s a very good save. 33 min: Newcastle 0-0 Nottm Forest Neco Williams does get a yellow card for a trrp on Tonali. 31 min: Newcastle 0-0 Nottm Forest Ryan Yates catches Bruno Guimaraes in the face with his elbow while trying to hold him off. VAR has a look but there wasn’t enough force to justify a red card. 28 min: Everton 0-0 Crystal Palace That Mitchell chance came in transition but Palace have had 68 per cent possession so far. 26 min: Everton 0-0 Crystal Palace Tyrick Mitchell misses a half chance for Palace thrashing just wide on the counter-attack. Did that brush the near post? Not sure. It wasn’t a goal so pipe down. Premier League latest Aston Villa 1-0 Burnley Everton 0-0 Crystal Palace Newcastle 0-0 Nottm Forest Wolves 1-0 Brighton Villa’s resurgence continues. Donyell Malen runs onto a terrific through ball from Kamara, slides forward and screws the ball carefully across Dubravka. Nice finish. 23 min: Newcastle 0-0 Nottm Forest Gibbs-White’s cross from the right finds Wood unmarked at the far post. He can’t decide whether to shoot first time or control the ball, and in the end does neither. That’s Forest’s best chance to date. Vitor Pereira is in the bowels of Molineux right now so he won’t have seen this opening goal. Marshall Munetsi’s sizzling volley was tipped brilliantly onto the underside of the bar by Verbruggen – but the ball rebounded off his trailing arm and into the net. Dumb luck for Verbruggen and Brighton. 21 min: Wolves 0-0 Brighton The Wolves head coach Vitor Pereira is off to the stands after being shown a red card. We’re not sure why at this stage, but as soon as somebody else reports it we’ll furnish you with second-hand information! 20 min: Newcastle 0-0 Nottm Forest Free-kick to Forest just outside the area. Gibbs-White whips it over the wall and Nick Pope beats it away; a comfortable enough save. Just before that, Jordan Pickford threw up his left hand to keep out Marc Guehi’s deflected snapshot. Good save. 17 min After 68 minutes (17x4) it’s still goalless in the inaugural Sky Sports multiview. 15 min: Newcastle 0-0 Nottm Forest A terrific save from Matz Sels, who reaches to his right to claw away Joelinton’s close-range header. 14 min Anyone else got a headache? 13 min: Aston Villa 0-0 Burnley Morgan Rogers’ shot takes a big deflection and loops just wide of the far post. The corner is headed towards goal by Ezri Konsa and pushed away dramatically by the diving Martin Dubravka. Good save. 12 min: Newcastle 0-0 Nottm Forest At St James’, Joelinton shoots too close to Matz Sels from about 12 yards. That was a pretty good chance. 10 min: Aston Villa 0-0 Burnley The Burnley left wing-back Quilindschy Hartman is put through on goal and denied by a fine save by Emi Martinez. 9 min: Everton 0-0 Crystal Palace Jack Grealish drives a crisp low shot from 15 yards that is saved comfortably by Dean Henderson. It looks an open game at Hill Dickinson Stadium. 5 min: Aston Villa 0-0 Burnley Nothing to report from the first five minutes at Villa Park. Villa will fancy their chances of making it four wins in a row in all competitions. 2 min: Everton 0-0 Crystal Palace Okay, I’m giving the multiview a go; it’s worth suffering a bit of pain for the greater good, eh? As I type, Jordan Pickford makes a good diving save from Yeremy Pino, whose shot from the edge of the area came through a crowd of players. 1 min: Newcastle 0-0 Nottm Forest Peep peep! We’re under way at St James’ Park and, presumably, in the other three games as well. It’s almost time for the action. Sky Sports are showing all four games on one screen, a first for their Premier League coverage, but it’s a bit headache-inducing and I’m already feeling unwell, so we’ll probably switch between the matches. On this day in 1997 … Patrick Berger scores a hat-trick against Ruud Gullit’s Chelsea. “Interesting to see that Forest’s pre-match tracksuits are beige, a reflection perhaps of their bland performances and results since ‘Big’ Ange took the helm,” says Jeremy Boyce. “But seriously, what was he thinking of, taking the Marinakis shilling? Or did he swallow it by accident?” That confused me too, because he must have known it would take time to implement such a fundamental change of style. Maybe he was desperate to FURB Spurs. Newcastle v Nottm Forest “Just quietly, mate, I don’t think Forest have been bad under Ange,” writes Chris Paraskevas. “The results are a little misleading: having watched a few of their games, they’ve either been genuinely unlucky, finished poorly or had every outfield player (including their goalkeeper), along with substitutes, all the backroom staff, the team bus driver, the mascot and the tea lady all pushed up for a (short) corner in the dying embers of a match. “I’m not Ange’s biggest fan for a bunch of reasons*, but I’m seriously wary of Forest’s attacking quality (including on their bench). Could be a few twists and turns in this one. * He rejected my ‘connection request’ on LinkedIn.” I can’t get my head round Ange Postecoglou being under so much pressure. He’s been there less a month. The only legitimate reason for sacking him at this stage would be if he slagged off Brian Clough’s green jumper, and even then a public apology would probably suffice. Everton v Crystal Palace “A beautiful day at this beautiful stadium for two very decent sides facing off,” writes your friend and mine, Gary Naylor. “Talking to some Palace lads on the way up, they were expecting a tough match, but agreed with me that JP Mateta is the difference. “Still, good to feel apprehension rather than fear... for now.” Wolves (4-3-3) Johnstone; Tchatchoua, S Bueno, Krejci, H Bueno; Munetsi, Andre, Joao Gomes; Arias, Larsen, Hwang.

Subs: Weiss, Worrall, Bruun Larsen, Ugochukwu, Edwards, Humphreys, Flemming, Broja, Mejbri. Referee Andrew Kitchen (Durham) All the talk is of where Oliver Glasner might go next. His contract expires at the end of the season and he has refused to sign an extension. He is 51; if he is going to take over a major club with the possibility of an extended spell in charge, he doesn’t have a huge amount of time to secure a move. Could he then be the solution for Manchester United? He does, after all, play the same 3-4-2-1 as Ruben Amorim, just rather more successfully. Which raises the question of why a system that has drawn so much scepticism at United works so well at Palace. But it’s never just about the formation, nor is it the case – within reason – that one formation is intrinsically better than another. Rather certain formations, in combination with the style they are enacted, prioritise certain elements of play. It is, at the very least, intriguing that since Harry Catterick’s Everton won the championship in 1962-63 with a W-M, only one side has won the English league title playing with a back three: Antonio Conte’s Chelsea in 2016-17. Newcastle v Nottm Forest Ange Postecoglou was appointed as Nottingham Forest manager less than a month ago. According to some reports, he could be sacked if Forest lose at Newcastle today. The Premier League table ahead of today’s action Hello, good afternoon and welcome to a four-pronged Premier League clockwatch. These are the matches we’ll be following: Aston Villa v Burnley Everton v Crystal Palace Newcastle v Nottm Forest Wolves v Brighton All four games kick off at 2pm. We’ll have team news and build up before that."
Grealish grabs late winner as Everton end Crystal Palace’s unbeaten run,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/05/everton-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report,"Oliver Glasner felt the pain of defeat for the first time since 16 April. Channelled the right way and Crystal Palace will become a better team, claimed a manager with much to be positive about. But that pain, laced with disbelief at losing their 19-game unbeaten run against Everton, will sting for some time yet. Glasner has worked wonders at Palace but improving his club’s miserable record against Everton proved a step too far. The visitors should have been celebrating a first win at Everton since 2014 but a lack of ruthlessness, a rare defensive lapse and a stirring finish from David Moyes’s side combined to shatter that aspiration. Jack Grealish’s somewhat fortunate 93rd-minute winner, his first Everton goal, secured an unlikely victory for the hosts after Iliman Ndiaye’s penalty had cancelled out Daniel Muñoz’s opener. Palace’s disbelieving players sank to their knees and rubbed their heads after seeing their proud unbeaten sequence vanish on the banks of the River Mersey. As well they might. “It hurts,” the Palace manager said. “For 60-70 minutes I saw a fantastic performance from our team but we didn’t decide the game when we could have done. I am a terrible loser and maybe in the international break I can reflect on this great run but it is not my feeling at the minute. “I told my players they can be really proud of the next chapter they wrote in the Crystal Palace history book after winning two trophies. The longest unbeaten run in over 120 years is a huge achievement but on the other side it feels like it should be at least 20 now. Maybe we need to feel this pain again. We don’t want it but we need it to make the next step forward.” Palace were hugely impressive in the first half, Everton a distant second best until the interval introductions of Carlos Alcaraz and Beto began to turn the tide. Even then Jean-Philippe Mateta should have put the game beyond the hosts. “I thought Crystal Palace might have a hangover from Thursday night,” said Moyes of his opponents’ European debut. “But they should have been out of sight. They should have been 3-0 up but we stuck at it and eventually got a bit of fortune.” Palace set the tone for a dominant first-half display from the start with long throws from Chris Richards and Adam Wharton’s incisive distribution causing Everton endless problems. Jordan Pickford, making his 300th Premier League appearance for Everton, was tested twice in the opening two minutes, by Yéremy Pino and Tyrick Mitchell. England’s undisputed No 1 goalkeeper made more impressive stops to keep out Marc Guéhi from close range and a first-time strike from Mateta. It was a question of when, not if, the visitors would take the lead and they did so with a goal that showcased Palace’s individual quality and the collective intelligence of a team that know precisely what their manager wants. The impressive Pino held up play well despite the close attentions of two Everton players to release Ismaïla Sarr. The Senegal international rolled a perfectly weighted pass into the overlapping Muñoz who, with Pickford rushing across goal, converted his second goal in two games with ease. “We’re gonna win the league,” sang the jubilant Palace hordes. Palace’s first-half superiority tried the patience of the home support almost as much as Everton’s performance. Moyes’s team were slow and sloppy, with the summer signings Thierno Barry and Tyler Dibling toiling badly. Both were unceremoniously hooked after 45 minutes. It was the third time in four games that Moyes has switched his two main strikers at half-time. The changes paid off. Barry’s replacement, Beto, and particularly Alcaraz injected an urgency and presence into the attack that had been absent. That said, Mateta squandered two clear openings before the home side could gather momentum, chipping Pickford when through on goal only for Jake O’Brien to head clear and somehow slicing wide of an exposed goal after Sarr’s shot deflected into his path. His second miss proved a key moment. Everton were handed a route back into the game when Maxence Lacroix misread Vitalii Mykolenko’s pass towards Beto and collided with Tim Iroegbunam as the substitute advanced on his blind side. It was a clear penalty and Ndiaye coolly sent Henderson the wrong way from the spot. Suddenly, having been in almost total control, Palace were on the back foot. In stoppage time Alcaraz released the goalscorer on the right. Ndiaye floated a beautiful cross into the six-yard box that Beto, in the words of his manager, “should have buried”. Henderson somehow saved at point-blank range but was beaten when Grealish read Muñoz’s attempted clearance and diverted the ball into the roof of the net. The roof of Hill Dickinson Stadium almost came off. Palace’s luck was out and their proud unbeaten run was history."
Newcastle’s Bruno Guimarães adds to Postecoglou’s Nottingham Forest crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/05/newcastle-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report,"Ange Postecoglou cut a solitary figure as he stood apart from his players and applauded the Nottingham Forest fans perched high in the Leazes End. His team had just extended their winless run to seven games under his charge yet as the Australian turned on his heel and strode towards the tunnel scratching his head, it seemed a little early for goodbyes. True, with talks with Forest’s board scheduled for this week, the manager’s future by the Trent seems as opaque as a fog on the Tyne, but it would surely be faintly ridiculous to sack him now, barely a month after succeeding Nuno Espírito Santo. Creditable performances alone can take a manager only so far but Forest’s latest defeat did feature some much-improved defensive organisation allied to the sort of sensible tactical pragmatism that succeeded in frustrating Newcastle during a low-key first half. Postecoglou looked a man alone at the final whistle but there was nothing to suggest his team have stopped playing for him. Significantly he deployed a back five for the first time in his Forest tenure; indeed it was only the second time the former Tottenham manager has used this starting system in the Premier League. Ultimately Newcastle upped their game with an eye-catching goal from Bruno Guimarães and a Nick Woltemade penalty offering Eddie Howe’s team a restorative second league victory of a season they are gradually growing into but it was no walk in the park against that defensive quintet. Perhaps attempting to change the narrative – or maybe endeavouring to repel a chilly October wind – Postecoglou also modelled a new club coat in the north-east. At kick-off that padded anorak swaddled him in the manner of a duvet but, on the evidence of his agitated body language, it seemed to be offering precious little comfort. Although Elliot Anderson at times upstaged even Sandro Tonali in midfield as he reminded everyone why Howe was so reluctant to sell him to Forest last year and Nikola Milenkovic marked Woltemade intelligently, Postecoglou’s constant grimaces reflected his fear that it still would not be quite enough to undo Newcastle. Even when Nicolò Savona began causing Dan Burn a few problems down the home left and, on one occasion even nutmegged the England defender, Forest’s manager struggled to raise a smile. At this juncture Woltemade was receiving minimal service to either his feet or his head and, despite considerable buzzing around on Anthony Gordon’s part, Newcastle’s creative department was not quite clicking. Admittedly it took a fine fingertip save on the part of Matz Sels – once a Newcastle goalkeeper – to keep Joelinton’s header out and the Brazilian midfielder missed a couple of other chances but, generally, the Forest defence held firm. Given that, since Postecoglou succeeded Nuno last month, the matches have come so thick and fast that there has been precious little time to put his theories into training ground practice it was a decent enough away display. Or at least it remained so until the suddenly irrepressible Guimarães lifted a curving right-foot shot over Sels and into a top corner from just outside the area. That finish left Postecoglou shaking his head in apparent despair, while wearing the anguished expression of a man who had just lost his house keys. His players complained of a perceived foul on Morgan Gibbs-White from Guimarães in the preamble but their protests fell on deaf officiating ears and, with Tonali now ascendant in midfield, Anderson was not the only visiting player being put in his place. By now Postecoglou had exchanged the anorak for a zip-up woolly cardigan with sleeves rolled up. With Forest rarely looking capable of scoring as they struggled to capitalise on rare counterattacks and Newcastle’s tempo heightening he was clearly feeling the heat. Sure enough, it took another fine save from Sels to keep Tonali’s volleyed cross-shot out before the resultant corner prefaced Woltemade’s half volley lashing the underside of the crossbar. Sels then made an excellent double save from Malick Thiaw and Harvey Barnes before finally being beaten again from the penalty spot by Woltemade. That spot kick was awarded when Anderson’s mistimed challenge sent Guimarães crashing. Up stepped the Germany striker to confound the keeper by lifting a rather audacious penalty into the top left-hand corner. It was Woltemade’s fourth goal for Newcastle since his £70m transfer from Stuttgart in August and made a further mockery of the claims of senior figures at Bayern Munich that Newcastle were “idiots” to pay so much money for a centre-forward whose ability to hold the ball up and use his adhesive touch to link play are already turning him into a Tyneside cult hero."
Van Hecke saves point for Brighton after Verbruggen’s own goal against Wolves,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/05/wolves-brighton-premier-league-match-report,"Jørgen Strand Larsen, denied a £55m move to Newcastle at the end of the transfer window, remonstrated angrily with the home team’s coaching staff on the full-time whistle after he had been substituted late on as, for the second successive week, Wolves’ bid to get their season up and running was stymied by a late equaliser. The Norway striker, recently back from an achilles injury, had just shot against a post, with Wolves leading through Bart Verbruggen’s own goal, as Brighton pushed for the leveller that duly arrived from Jan Paul van Hecke. Vítor Pereira, the Wolves head coach, had been dismissed just before the Premier League’s bottom side went ahead in the first half, when Marshall Munetsi’s volley rebounded off the bar, the goalkeeper and in. Fabian Hürzeler’s side deserved a point for their second-half dominance but Wolves, after conceding in stoppage time to draw at Tottenham, had looked as if they were going to hang on for the first top-flight victory of the season. Strand Larsen looked Wolves’ best bet for a second goal and the home team were less able to get out from their low block with the slighter Jhon Arias leading the line. As if trying to recover from another winless start was not a big enough peak to climb, letting in late levellers is turning hills into mountains. Wolves somehow recovered from a terrible start to last season, when they gained one point from eight games, to avoid relegation on the back of a near miraculous run of six successive league wins either side of Easter, Pereira having replaced Gary O’Neil in December. Asking them to do the same again without the goals and talent of Matheus Cunha and Rayan Aït-Nouri would be remarkable. So playing to their strengths looks like a prerequisite. Again they displayed heart, determination and improved cohesion for large spells and can at least claim a three-match unbeaten run, including the Carabao Cup. But Strand Larsen’s goals and hold-up play are also a big part of their armoury. He was not looking sulky when, 14 minutes from time, Luís Miguel, Pereira’s assistant manager, replaced him with Jean-Ricner Bellegarde; he was incredulous. After Van Hecke had thudded home his second Brighton goal and the final whistle was accompanied by boos from Wolves fans fed up with their talent being continuously diminished, Strand Larsen flicked aside offers of handshakes from the coaching staff. He went on to the pitch to acknowledge his teammates and applaud the fans, but his frustration at the tactical decision was palpable. “When you don’t get the three points, you talk about the substitutions,” Luís Miguel said. “He has been coming back from injury and he’s still not 100%. It was a decision from Vítor and the technical staff.” The game had exploded into life in the middle of the first half. Pereira was furious at Jarred Gillett’s decision not to award a free-kick when João Gomes was jostled by Carlos Baleba and then, after the referee cautioned Baleba for a clearer foul on Hugo Bueno, the red card was shown to the Wolves head coach for booting a spare ball off a cone at the officials’ dugout. Luís Miguel relayed his colleague’s apology. The fire had been lit. When a long free-kick from Danny Welbeck was headed out only as far as Munetsi to the right of the penalty spot, he dispatched a veritable hammer of a shot goalwards. Although Verbruggen managed to tip the ball against the bar, it rebounded down and over the line off the goalkeeper’s glove. Arias side-footed over the bar from six yards after a superb counterattack led by Strand Larsen prompted the overlapping Hugo Bueno to cross low. Sam Johnstone saved superbly from Georginio Rutter but Wolves so nearly put the game to bed when Strand Larsen shot against a post. Brighton, with their deeply impressive record at Molineux – they had won their four previous games here – and a good start to the season to boot, took charge in the second half. Wolves felt the ball had already gone behind for a goal-kick when Jackson Tchatchoua nudged it on. From Yankuba Minteh’s short corner, Maxim De Cuyper crossed and, after Stefanos Tzimas got a slight flick-on, Van Hecke headed powerfully home to earn a point. “It was a good performance but not a great performance,” Hürzeler said. “The most important thing is to show resilience and character and JP is a great role model for that.”"
Goals in each half from Donyell Malen give Aston Villa edge over Burnley,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/05/aston-villa-burnley-premier-league-match-report,"As Aston Villa appeared to be cantering towards a fourth successive victory in all competitions, it was hard not to wonder: what was all the fuss about? Donyell Malen was the match-winner for Villa in Unai Emery’s 150th game in charge of the club, the Dutchman applying a pair of expert finishes after seizing a rare start, this his fourth in the league since signing from Borussia Dortmund in January. Out of nowhere Burnley halved the deficit through the substitute Lesley Ugochukwu, who headed in on 78 minutes, but a first away point this season proved beyond them. “Malen! Malen! Malen!” was the chant that rained down from the stands at the final whistle and while these were his first goals of the season and Erling Haaland is fast approaching 20 for club and country, this double felt significant. “It’s important to keep working, whenever you have a chance to be there,” Malen said. “Last season we were in the Champions League so we have to push for that again.” The mood around Villa this international break will be much better than the last, having headed into September winless and off a shapeless 3-0 home defeat to Crystal Palace. “The last break we had, we were a little bit sad and, of course, now we will carry on working,” Emery said, adding the next fortnight will provide an opportunity to further embed Harvey Elliott, an unused substitute, and Jadon Sancho, who was again absent from the squad, Villa citing illness. A week on from savouring their first league win of the season, Villa Park was a discernibly happier place, the home support providing an early backing track in support of Emery, poised to celebrate his third anniversary in charge this month. The Villa manager made four changes from Thursday’s Europa League victory at Feyenoord, Malen among those promoted to the starting lineup with Emiliano Martínez returning in goal after pulling out of the warm-up in the Netherlands. Before Ugochukwu headed in Quilindschy Hartman’s cross it was apparent Villa’s biggest danger was probably themselves – and so it proved, some slack marking allowing the former Chelsea midfielder to send the ball through the legs of Martínez, who appeared to lose focus. Unsurprisingly, Burnley roused from there but they could not prevent a fifth defeat in six matches in all competitions and they have conceded 15 Premier League goals, one shy of the 16 they conceded across the entire Championship season en route to promotion as runners-up. This has been a peculiar year for Malen, who was left out of Villa’s Champions League squad a couple of weeks after signing and has struggled to pin down a place in Emery’s side. But against Burnley he showed the clinical streak and cold-blooded finishing that prompted the Villa manager to revisit the club’s interest in the winger. Malen held off Maxime Estève after latching on to Boubacar Kamara’s perfect pass into a gaping hole in the Burnley defence and, off balance, he potted the ball across Martin Dubravka and into the far corner. Cue a gleeful knee slide. Malen’s second goal, shortly after the hour, was even better, a touch-and-bang finish after reading Morgan Rogers’s cute through ball; Rogers was the catalyst for Villa’s first, too, sidestepping the Burnley captain Josh Cullen and Josh Laurent before locating Kamara 10 yards inside the Villa half. This time Malen composed himself with his first touch and then used the laces of his right boot to blast a shot past Dubravka with his next. “When you switch off in this league, you get punished,” Cullen said. The only lasting soreness for Villa was felt by Emiliano Buendía. The Argentinian entered midway through the second half in place of Villa’s captain John McGinn but was forced off in the 10th minute of added time after the Burnley substitute Zian Flemming caught him in the face with an elbow. After a lengthy stoppage, Buendía was withdrawn, Villa using a concussion substitute. “He is recovering and getting better,” Emery said. “The last month has been very good: draws against Everton, Brentford and Sunderland and now we have won four matches. We have to make Villa Park a fortress again.” Estève was the only member of the Burnley backline here who was also part of their mean defence last season and their manager, Scott Parker, conceded there was a naivety to his side. The cruise ship-sized gap Kamara spied between Estève and Hartman, which led to the opening goal, an obvious sign that things are still a work in progress. “It’s another brand-new team, it is a brand-new defensive line and we are working tirelessly with that,” said Parker, alluding to the 14 players signed after promotion, six of whom started at Villa, four more arriving from the bench. “We looked a bit young.”"
Struggling West Ham’s WSL defeat by Villa exposes lack of clinical finishing,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/05/west-ham-aston-villa-wsl-match-report,"West Ham are not a bad team, far from it. There is talent in their squad, and desire. You can see it in every tackle, every gut-busting run and in the frustrated body language when a pass doesn’t quite come off. That energy is matched on the sideline. Rehanne Skinner was animated throughout her side’s 2-0 defeat – “hold the line”, “come closer”, “talk to her” and “Fion can’t get out” were among the many commands from the technical area, with those behind the dugout treated to the thoughts of the manager while the action was under way. Skinner is in it, she is engaged, the players are engaged, so what is not working? Five games in and they have no points, have conceded 16 goals and scored twice. They can score though, five different goal scorers in a 5-1 defeat of Charlton in the League Cup on 24 September a brief respite from defeat before Chelsea scored three in 15 minutes last weekend to put them firmly back in their place. Against the Blues the Hammers weren’t bad throughout though – that 15-minute calamitous spell was an outlier and, while many feared a complete second-half collapse, they regrouped, thrived with their backs against the wall, and only conceded one more to the champions. Consistency across a whole game has been a regular problem. The first five minutes and second half against Chelsea were periods to be proud of, as was the opening 45 against Arsenal and closing 45 against Brighton. Against Villa the story was familiar, the visiting team dominating possession in Dagenham but the Hammers having chances too, nine shots to Villa’s 11. They were in it in the first half, challenging, playing well enough to be able to take something from the game, the difference though was that West Ham had only a single shot on target, as opposed to Villa’s four. West Ham are not being let down by their style, grit or managerial decisions, they are being let down by players not being clinical when they get in good positions. It is that decision-making in the final third that needs work, the five goals scored against Women’s Super League 2 side Charlton perhaps points to the issue: when they have time on the ball they make the right moves, when they are being pressed and harried by top-flight opposition it’s almost like they struggle to think quickly enough. “I don’t think we were clinical enough in the final third and we just lacked that cutting edge where the final ball was sometimes a bit over hit, not quite with the right quality and then just being prepared to take on shots a little bit earlier,” said Skinner. “Based on the players, when I’m watching them individually, I just feel like they’re all a little bit hesitant compared to where we were previously. The desire to run at people and be quite assertive was really, really strong and we just need to get that fight back where we’re a little bit more ruthless in and around the box, where we are a bit braver to go 1v1 and where what will be will be but we’re committing players and we’re trying to create opportunities. That’s something that we’ve just sort of taken our foot off the gas a little bit on and we’re looking for passes as opposed to being a little bit more direct and being a bit more confident in our own ability.” On Sunday afternoon that was costly again. Moments after Viviane Asseyi glanced a header wide, they were punished at the other end, Kirsty Hanson collecting her short corner back from Lynn Wilms before lashing the ball into the far corner. Seven minutes later and Natalia Arroyo’s side had a bigger cushion, Wilms’s free-kick lifted over the wall and in. The Hammers’ lack of points on the board will inevitably lead to questions being asked about Skinner’s future. That would be wholly unfair though. There is work to be done for sure, confidence must improve, and the players must bear some responsibility for that, but this is a team that is struggling from a lack of love and care from the club as a whole and Skinner is a victim of that rather than the architect of the team’s struggles. This summer, nine players departed and only four came in. The quality of those coming in this time round was arguably higher overall, but a tight budget has meant that, season on season, West Ham have lost their best players to better teams. Before questions are asked about Skinner’s tenure, she deserves a chance to show what she can do unhindered and that means the club upping its game – and the same could be said for several WSL sides."
Ipswich savour first derby win in 16 years and Núñez rubs salt in Norwich wounds,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/05/ipswich-norwich-championship-match-report,"Sixteen years of hurt have finally come to an end for Ipswich Town. A curse that had lingered for longer than that on most abandoned burial grounds was banished in conclusive fashion as their East Anglian rivals were defeated 3-1 and generally outclassed in the home side’s first win in 15 derbies. Goals from the man of the match, Cédric Kipré, the mercurial Jaden Philogene and Jack Clarke were the decisive moments of the match, Norwich’s kamikaze attacking another factor. But the figure of Marcelino Núñez, who scored against Ipswich for Norwich in the last derby two seasons ago and then completed a £10m move to Suffolk in the summer, loomed throughout. Featuring on the cover of the programme and in the voices of the Ipswich support, even as he started the match on the bench, this was a transfer troll that ultimately achieved the desired effect. Ipswich’s Kieran McKenna was keen to play down the Núñez factor, even after the Chilean had taken his own victory lap around Portman Road at the final whistle and stroked the Ipswich crest on a corner flag. “His motivation to come here was nothing about his feelings about Norwich,” McKenna insisted, though he was on more convincing ground when he spoke of a “deserved” win for his team that can be a “big moment for us going forward”. After a peppy atmosphere in and around the ground, the opening half hour was as scrappy as chip paper. But Ipswich took the lead with a well-worked set piece. The delivery came from Philogene – a deep outswinger that found Dara O’Shea at the back post. He nodded the ball down to the penalty spot and, after something of a scramble, it came to Kipré who took a touch and crashed the ball into the net. This was what a fractious home crowd had been after and Ipswich looked well-placed to kick on, but Norwich scrapped their way back into the match. Again it came from a set piece – Kellen Fisher’s corner was aimed at Harry Darling at the back post, but cleared out to the Danish teenager Oscar Schwartau who hit a low shot straight back at goal and, via a minor deflection, past a stranded Alex Palmer. Norwich were euphoric and Ipswich’s support more volatile. This was a story they had seen many times. But one consistent during a scratchy opening to the season has been the goalscoring form of Philogene, and he was about to strike again. With the clock having just ticked to 45 minutes and Norwich playing triangles in the middle of the pitch, the midfielder Pelle Mattsson inexplicably let the ball pass between his legs and through to a lurking Philogene. He wasted no time in advancing on goal and unleashing a rising drive from 25 yards that clipped the top of Vladan Kovacevic’s fingers but burst into the top corner of the net. His celebration – a na-na-na-na-na with his fingers in his ears – may require some work. At half-time the Ipswich legend Jim Magilton came on to the pitch to urge the fans to stick the course and pledged that Norwich’s high defensive line would offer more opportunities. He was very much proved right. After the restart Ipswich were increasingly able to exploit the space offered up by Norwich’s advanced full-backs. George Hirst alone should have scored twice from the opportunities served up. With 15 minutes to go, and the game still keenly poised, Núñez had his moment. Emerging on to the field to a round of raucous chanting (set to the tune of Zombie by the Cranberries, aka ‘Rory McIlroy’s in your head’), three minutes later he had made the decisive contribution the narrative had forewarned. Finding the ball after Darling had been robbed of possession, Núñez instantly read the situation and spun a pass behind that high line into fellow substitute Iván Azón. The Spaniard shot sharply past Kovacevic, but on to the post, where Clarke was on hand to turn the rebound home. The last 15 minutes were a battering for the visitors, with Núñez’s post-match gallivanting only rubbing it in. A sullen Liam Manning, with only eight points in his first nine games as Norwich manager, described the result as “hugely disappointing”. Calling on his players to “step up”, he said: “We’ve got to take responsibility. We’ve got to be a lot tougher on ourselves.” • This article was amended on 5 October 2025. Liam Manning is the manager of Norwich City, not Ryan Manning as an earlier version said."
"WSL clockwatch: Spurs edge Brighton, London City Lionesses beat Liverpool and more – as it happened",https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/oct/05/postecoglou-nottingham-forest-wsl-ipswich-norwich-matchday-live,"That’s all from the WSL and East Anglia derby. Check out the Premier League clockwatch. Ipswich record their first win against Norwich in sixteen years. The match will most likely be remembered for Philogene’s marvellous strike. The full time whistle blows around the grounds. Here are the final scores: Spurs 1-0 Brighton London City Lionesses 1-0 Liverpool West Ham 0-2 Aston Villa Leicester v Everton 1-1 Yes they can! Elena Linari smashes the ball off the crossbar and past the keeper. 88 min: London City Lionesses win a penalty late on. Nikita Parris receives a through ball and the Liverpool keeper comes but doesn’t win the ball. Can the home side get a winner? Ipswich keep going and play Iván Azón through on goal. The Spanish striker runs away from the Norwich defender and angles his low strike onto the post. The ball rebounds into the path of Jack Clarke and he taps the ball past the keeper. Noémie Mouchon picks the ball up in the middle and drives to the heart of the Everton defence. She twists and turns before taking a shot. It goes through the keeper at the near post. Game on! Ipswich 2-1 Norwich 68 min: Kovačević hasn’t covered himself in glory today. This time he flaps at a cross and palms it away to Philogene. He lays off to a teammate but his shot lands safely in Kovačević’s hands. A special free kick from Lynn Wilms. The Aston Villa defender stands over the ball on the edge of the box, slightly right of centre. Wilms decides to hit the ball on the keeper’s side and she beats Szemik with pace and precision. That was right in the top corner! Screamer! Aston Villa win a corner and work it well on the right hand side. The ball is rolled into Hanson’s path outside of the area. The midfielder lets it run across her body and rifles the ball into the top corner with her left foot. Ipswich 2-1 Norwich 53 min: Ipswich play themselves into trouble in attempt to pass the ball out from the back. Josh Sargent gets the ball but hits it at the keeper from a tight angle. Ipswich 2-1 Norwich 51 min: Good chance for Norwich. They work the ball well on the left. Mirko Topić receives it on the edge of the area but drags his shot wide of the near post. Spurs 1-0 Brighton 54 min: What a strike from Eveliina Summanen! Spurs win a free kick in the middle of Brighton’s half and the Spurs midfielder smashes the set piece through the wall and forces the keeper to make a good save. It’s not taken long for Everton to get off the mark in the second half. The ball is clipped over the top to Ornella Vignola who takes down the ball brilliantly. She flicks it round a defender before jinking past another. Maintaining her balance, the Everton midfielder rolls the ball with her right foot and finishes with her left. Great goal. Check out the only goal from the first half of WSL action. The second half starts across the WSL. A lively end to the first half in the East Anglia derby. It’s shaping up very nicely for the second half. What a goal! That was brilliant from Jaden Philogene. He picks up the ball outside of the centre circle with a lovely turn away from his man. He carries the ball forward before smashing the ball over the keeper from about 35 yards out. Wow. That’s half time around the grounds. Here are the scores: Spurs 1-0 Brighton London City Lionesses 0-0 Liverpool West Ham 0-0 Aston Villa Leicester v Everton 0-0 An immediate response from Norwich! This time Norwich win a corner. An outswinging ball comes in from the right and Ipswich manage to half clear it away. It’s only as far as Oscar Schwartau who hits it on the volley past the keeper. What a finish! Ipswich swing the ball into the box from a corner. Vladan Kovačević tries and fails to punch the first ball, causing chaos in the Norwich box. It falls for Cédric Kipré, who smashes the ball into the top corner like a striker. West Ham v Aston Villa 30 min: Aston Villa should have scored! Chasity Grant breaks free on the right and cuts the ball back for Kirsty Hanson. With the goal gaping, the Aston Villa winger somehow puts the ball past the post. Spurs take the lead! Jess Naz and Amanda Nildén link up well on the left hand side. The Swedish midfielder sets Naz free and the winger delivers a wicked cross to Cathinka Tandberg at the back post. The Tottenham forward calmly taps the ball into the back of the net. Spurs v Brighton 20 min: Brighton have struggled to test Lize Kop so far. Most of their chances have come from Spurs’ unforced errors. Spurs v Brighton 4 min: Brighton should have had a penalty. Spurs defender Tōko Koga slips in her own area and brings Jelena Čanković down as she scrambles to get back up. Koga may have inadvertently handled the ball in the process. How has the referee not given that? We’re under way in the East Anglia derby! We’re under way in the Women’s Super League!

Henry messages keep Saka sharp as he makes 200th Premier League appearance Bukayo Saka’s second-half penalty ensured the Gunners downed London rivals West Ham 2-0, it was also his 200th appearance in the Premier League, an occasion he marked with his 100th goal involvement in the competition. Asked about those stats and Henry, Saka told broadcasters he got a message from Arsenal legend Thierry Henry ahead of the game: “Thierry always messages me. He messaged me this (Saturday) morning as well to remind me we lost the last two games to West Ham at home. “He is always pushing me and I think he wants me there with him. It is nice to have that encouragement from him and of course me, I want it as well. “I’m really happy on these records. I’m just going to keep pushing and try and get some team trophies, which is what we have been searching for.” The penalty was Saka’s 55th goal in the Premier League to go with 45 assists. “I don’t really like to linger on these things, but you said it - it’s a beautiful achievement and I’m really proud of it,” Saka said. “Obviously 200 games for Arsenal in the Premier League is a really big moment. I’m going to enjoy it and it was nice to get the goal as well and the win.” Quotes via PA Media. More on Ange from Jeff Sax via email (keep those coming in): After last season’s disaster at Spurs, it was obvious Ange wasn’t suited for the Premier League.

His side head to Falkirk today, where anything other than win will spell the end, right? Right? I love the phrase ‘shagged himself’ here. Some very lively debate over the Forest situation going on below the line, keep it coming, great stuff: A lot of money was spent in the Premier League this summer. Not all of it well, but some of the new arrivals are starting to shine. Benjamin Sesko has two in two, Mohammed Kudus also bagged and Estevao got the late winner for Chelsea against Liverpool. How are you feeling about your club’s new signings? This piece from the Guardian Sports Network looks at the progress of a few of the league’s new arrivals: My contacts in the Tractor Boys community are very confident, too confident? In La Liga, Real Madrid brushed aside Villarreal yesterday but Barcelona will go back to the summit if they can win at Sevilla. This not a vintage Sevilla team, although an ageing Alexis Sanchez will get a chance to play against his od club, which is nice. I mentioned Genoa are at Napoli today, amongst their ranks is Brooke Norton-Cuffy, who played a part in England Under 21s defending their European crown thgis summer. He has been chatting Ed Aarons about life in Serie A: You would have to say the best of the Euro action is coming from Serie A today. Roma, Napoli and AC Milan are all tied on 12 points, as are Inter but they have played a game more. Roma travel to Fiorentina after a Europa League defeat at home against Lille, Napoli beat Sporting in midweek and host Genoa at 5pm, then Juventus play Milan in Turin. Woof. Nicky Bandini’s Serie A column should be a cracker this week. Do you know who won again yesterday? Only bloody Hearts. Jambos do you think this is sustainable? Celtic host Motherwell today and cut the gap to two points but Derek McInnes’s side cannot stop winning right now, even if they keep leaving it very late. Fascinating stuff happening north of the border and not all of it in Glasgow. PeterPrincey hits on an interesting point here. My theory is because the Premier League is a league of managers, where players are secondary. All the narrative comes from the men in the dugout and therefore anytime their teams take a dip they are the fall guys. Liverpool play badly and it is Slot’s fault, City play well because Pep Guardiola is a genius and so on. While there is certainly some truth in that, they are also a vector through which we compute our understanding of the game. I’ve swalled a thesaurus this morning. Coming up at 11.55am (BST, yes it’s still technically summer time) we’ll be bringing you live updates from the full slate of Sunday fixtures in the WSL. My colleague Xaymaca Awoyungbo will be in the chair be then. Here’s a reminder of the fixture list: Leicester v Everton London City Lionesses v Liverpool Tottenham Hotspur v Brighton West Ham v Aston Villa There were some pretty unhappy scenes in the EFL yesterday, namely at Hillsborough where play was stopped for five minutes due to the latest fan protest against Sheffield Wednesday owner Dejphon Chansiri. It was a miserable afternoon for Owls fans as their side was shellacked 5-0 by visitors Coventry. Steve Bruce also had a bad day. Blackpool’s poor start to the season continued with a 2-0 home defeat against AFC Wimbledon and afterwards Bruce was dismissed from his position at Bloomfield Road. Blackpool fans, who do you want to see come in? Still plenty of time to turn the season around. Wednesday fans, I’m sorry, you have my deepest sympathies. On the subject of doing the opposite, how are Ipswich fans feeling about today? Will the Old Farm hoodoo finally be broken? Get in touch via the link above or below the line the comment section. This is a textbook case of the football fan reverse anxiety complex, it’s commonly associated with the great philosopher George Costanza, who said that if everything is telling me one thing, then I must do the opposite: Some fixtures just don’t sound right. Maybe it’s just about conceivable that, had things gone slightly differently in the 70s, Malcolm Allison or Terry Venables could have been leading their side behind the Iron Curtain for a crack at Valeriy Lobanovskyi’s cybernauts, but Dynamo Kyiv against Crystal Palace is still a clash that provokes a double-take. It feels like a category error: how can those two clubs possibly be in the same competition? But this is the modern world. Ukraine is battling invasion, its teams diminished. The Premier League is extremely rich. And Crystal Palace are managed by one of the rising talents of the European game. They didn’t just play each other on Thursday, but Palace won with a degree of comfort. It was their third straight win, their 19th consecutive game without defeat. And so, because no mid-size club can even just be allowed to enjoy a good run, all the talk is of where Oliver Glasner might go next. His contract expires at the end of the season and he has refused to sign an extension. He is 51; if he is going to take over a major club with the possibility of an extended spell in charge, he doesn’t have a huge amount of time to secure a move. Could he then be the solution for Manchester United? He does, after all, play the same 3-4-2-1 as Ruben Amorim, just rather more successfully. Read Jonathan Wilson’s column in full here: Have you got Erling Haaland in your fantasy team? Of course you have, he already has eight goals in the Premier League and is running away in the golden boot race. Here’s the full list of the Premier League’s top scorers: After Estevao’s late winner at Stamford Bridge last night Chelsea Enzo Maresca set off on a manic touchline dash to celebrate with his team. It was maybe the most fun thing Maresca has ever done and he was sent off, meaning he will watch Chelsea’s next match from the stands, but Barney Ronay writes that it is his opposite number yesterday, Arne Slot, who has bigger issues to address when he is next on the touchline: At Old Trafford, the dark clouds lifted lifted on Saturday as Benjamin Sesko clicked with his teammates and as he Mason Mount got themselves on the scoresheet. Post-match Mount insisted that the club are “100% behind” embattled boss Ruben Amorim: Arsenal, the latest team to inherit the moniker of champions in waiting, handily saw off West Ham on Saturday but they are counting the cost of that victory. Martin Ødegaard picked up a knee injury and had to come off before half time again. Declan Rice, who scored the game’s first goal, also departed early with a back injury. More from Ed Aarons here: Liverpool’s third defeat in a row has seen the spotlight move on to the relationship, or lack thereof, between Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak. The Reds couldn’t break down a Chelsea team missing almost all of their first choice centre-backs. Liverpool head coach Arne Slot is not concerned, yet: “The more they play together the more they will connect,” the Liverpool manager said. “You have to work really hard to reach a certain level and then it’s very hard in football because you also play against very good teams to keep that level going. What I mean by that is consistency.” More from Slot here: Hello, good morning and welcome to Sunday’s Matchday live! Before we head of on our international breaks we have one more action-packed day of Premier League action, with five fixtures and the opportunity for UK viewers to go multiview on their Sky boxes with four of those at 2pm. Before any of that, four fixtures in the WSL. The pick of those is Tottenham v Brighton, two teams hoping to break into the European places. Then, the East Anglian derby is a lovely little midday livener. Amazingly Ipswich haven’t beaten Norwich since 2009. If you want some bizarre pop culture context, the last time the Tractor Boys won this fixture Kanye West hadn’t yet interrupted Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech for winning best female video at the MTV Awards (for what it’s worth, Beyoncé did have one of the best videos of all time!). In the Premier League, the narrative comes from St James’ Park but not the home team, who are simply going about their business. Yes, I am of course referring to Ange Postecoglou and the threat hanging over his continued employment as the man in the dugout for Nottingham Forest. The chances of another game without a win are high for the Australian gaffer, with Newcastle nothing if not solid. Did you know that Crystal Palace haven’t lost in ages? They take that proud record to Everton, where the Eagles’ ability to recover from a gruelling European away day will be tested. Likewise Aston Villa, who are playing Burnley in a game for the soul of the colour claret. Quite why Wolves v Brighton is being played on a Sunday at 2pm is not clear. Neither had a European game in midweek, but here we are. Wolves were better at Tottenham last time out, Brighton won at Stamford Bridge. This one is anyone’s guess. Then in the headline slot, Brentford look to be the Manchester slayers for the second week in a row. City will probably be less accomodating than United, but they are vulnerable, as was evidenced at the Stade Louis II in midweek. But before we jump into today’s action, let’s quickly recap some of the headlines from Saturday…"
Brooke Norton-Cuffy: ‘Vieira was great as a player and he’s a great manager now’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/05/brooke-norton-cuffy-genoa-serie-a-arsenal-england-under-21s,"If there was a secret to the togetherness among the England Under-21s players as they retained their European title this summer then Brooke Norton-Cuffy may have let it slip: a card game called Werewolf. Introduced to the senior England camp during the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, it pits a small informed group called the wolves against the uninformed majority known as the villagers as they attempt to deceive each other to win, in a format similar to the popular TV show The Traitors. “We were playing every night,” says Norton-Cuffy. “It really helped us bond because you get to know people. In this day and age when everyone can be on their phones, you sit down, you have a laugh, you have a joke … the group was really, really tight, everyone was together, and you saw that on the pitch when we ended up going and winning it.” Such is the life of a young player that Lee Carsley’s squad had only a few hours to celebrate their dramatic late victory over Germany before they went their separate ways. In Norton-Cuffy’s case, it was to board a flight to Genoa – the club he joined in August 2024 after a decade at Arsenal – before heading off on a well-deserved holiday. “It was a quick, quick turnaround, so I would say we probably didn’t get to enjoy it as much as we should have, but I think that’s just football,” he says. “But I don’t feel like it was a shock for this group to go and win it. We all felt like: ‘We should win the tournament, and we are going to win the tournament,’ so when we did it, it was like: ‘OK, we’ve done it, we’re proud of ourselves, let’s take our holidays, but now everyone’s got to go and rip up at their clubs.’” Norton-Cuffy has certainly taken that momentum into the Serie A campaign. Having missed a large portion of his first season owing to injuries, the 21-year-old from Southwark has become a regular under the Arsenal legend Patrick Vieira and says he is regularly recognised around the port city. Genoa are Italy’s oldest club, founded by a group of English expatriates in 1893, and the new away shirt that Norton-Cuffy helped to promote features the St George’s Cross in a nod to their heritage. “I feel like a lot of Italians seem to have connected with me in that way, because I’m English, and because of how the club was founded,” he says. “It’s strangely come together very nicely.” Norton-Cuffy is following in the footsteps of another flying full-back from south London in Djed Spence, who spent four and a half months at Genoa on loan from Tottenham in 2024. Norton-Cuffy decided to leave Arsenal after successful loans at Lincoln, Rotherham, Millwall and Coventry, turning down offers from two Premier League sides and clubs in Germany. “I wanted to come here, play and experience a new style of football, experience a new culture and put myself outside what I’d say is my comfort zone, because I could have easily stayed in England and played for an English team. But I said: ‘Let me try the challenge abroad. Let me learn a new culture.’ The Italian league is known for its defensive abilities, structure, style of play. So I said: ‘Let me come and improve on my defensive side of the game, but also show what I can do going forward and bring my own style to this league.’” Norton-Cuffy is known for lung‑bursting runs down the right and puts his energy down to a carb‑loading regime that starts three days before a match. Many of his meals are provided by Genoa but he learned to cook at Arsenal – one of the skills young players are taught at the Hale End academy. “They helped me mature into a man, with stuff on the pitch and off the pitch,” says Norton-Cuffy. “At Arsenal, you’re going there and you’re learning to be better every day. If you’re not learning about football, you’re learning about how to cook. It’s come in handy, 100%. They always made sure you were doing your psychology work, stuff like that. And then on the pitch, obviously it’s Arsenal Football Club: the level, the standard is extremely high, so I feel like it has helped me out a lot.” Genoa have made a slow start, taking two points from five league games, but playing under Vieira remains a dream come true for Norton-Cuffy. He credits the former France midfielder, who replaced Alberto Gilardino last November, for improving his positional skills: “He was a great player, he’s a great manager now and he’s helped me a lot since he’s come in. The objective is to get as high as possible. First we need to hit the 40-point mark, I think it is, make sure we’re safe, and then look from there, but I think this group is capable of doing some very good things.” Within minutes of England’s summer triumph, Carsley was targeting a hat-trick of victories for the under-21s in 2027. Norton‑Cuffy, part of the under‑19s squad that won their European title in 2022, is expected to start the under-21s’ qualifiers against Moldova and Andorra this month and says Carsley has also been a major influence on his career. “When I had difficult moments last year, he would take the time out to give me a call, say: ‘Keep going, you know your quality,’ give you a little pep talk. He’s always there. When you’re playing for the under-21s, they stress it in every single camp: the goal is not to be in the under-21s, the goal is to be in England’s first team. So it’s dependent on what I do for the under-21s and how well I do at my club. It’s for me to push myself out there and that’s on me.”"
Maresca’s wild sprint a red-hot release after Chelsea stifle misfiring Liverpool,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/04/enzo-maresca-wild-sprint-red-hot-release-chelsea-stifle-misfiring-liverpool,"Unleash the carefully metered ticker-tape gun. Crack out the cautiously decanted champagne. This is a game that will perhaps be remembered above all for Enzo’s Run. With 95 minutes on the clock, as Chelsea’s 18-year-old substitute Estêvão Willian scored the winning goal even before the shared intake of air around Stamford Bridge had been transformed into a barrelling roar, Enzo Maresca was off, sprinting down his touchline at astonishing speed, and showing classical form, hands carving the air, knees high, like a small, bald track-suited Allan Wells, then leaping with his players into the crowd. Maresca had been weirdly animated all game, out there in full-figure hugging Galactic Jade club nylons and sculpted quilted coat, bristly, bald, even quite twinkly, like an ageing Jedi on his way to the gym. As Chelsea took the lead in the first half he even tried to conduct the crowd, demanding more noise, more heat, albeit with something oddly accusatory in his gestures. Eventually Maresca returned from the mosh pit. He was sent off for his touchline run, an act of entirely alien positional insurrection from the most deathly of systems-managers. He disappeared, replaced by a generic baldy-beardy man from his stable of back-ups, and didn’t appear again at the end. Perhaps the rumours are true and Maresca just kept running, out of the ground and down the Fulham Road, passing Whitechapel by the time the sprinklers came on. But then, this was momentous game in many ways. Mainly for Liverpool. Perhaps there will be relief of sorts. Either way the rabbits that have been rustling in the tree line for the past six weeks have finally come gambolling out into the paddock. Liverpool have lost three games in a row, two on successive league weekends. They are not, repeat not, top of the table. This had to happen some time. It has been over a year now, the morning of 24 September 2024, since the last time last Arne Slot’s team weren’t at least level on points at the top. And by the end a 2-1 defeat here felt like a comprehensive status report on this team, its obvious strengths and its obvious flaws, the fact it seems every week now to be playing both its opponents and the glitches and snags in its own system. Is this a crisis? Playing badly and winning in late season is a thing. Playing badly and winning in early season. Well, then you’re just playing badly. But if it is a crisis it’s quite an attractive one, a team that is still chugging along in the middle lane even as Slot works furiously under the bonnet. What will bother Slot is the way opposition managers are taking it in turns to pick at those holes, to work him out a little in advance, as Oliver Glasner did last weekend, and as Maresca did here. Stamford Bridge had been chilly, grey and breezy at kick-off, the kind of day that seems always to be trying to get inside your shirt or up your sleeve. Maresca’s initial success came from playing Malo Gusto in midfield, creating a suffocating central block. Liverpool were squeezed and hurried. Every time Alexis Mac Allister took the ball in deep areas Gusto was all over him, man-marking the fulcrum, choking Liverpool at source. With 15 minutes gone neither team had created a chance. Then something out of the box happened. Moisés Caicedo found time and space on the ball, empty grass ahead of him. He took two more steps. Still nothing. Virgil van Dijk ran to his left apparently reacting to some swarming sense of danger. Presumably Van Dijk hasn’t watched Chelsea much. But it was enough. Caicedo had had time to set himself and shoot right to left into the top corner, a wonderfully pure strike, still rising as it clanged the metal strut that holds the net. After that the system continued to work in the same way. Liverpool had two shots by half-time, none on target. You want to know what really gets to Maresca, what fills his legs with dynamite? Elite stifling. High-end interruption. And Chelsea did it here. If that first half showcased Maresca’s ability to set these traps where there is no urgency to drive the game forward, it also showed why Liverpool signed Florian Wirtz. Slot had spoken before this game about the need for a different kind of midfielder. Wirtz came on at the break and almost immediately found Mohamed Salah with a lovely spinning touch. Salah fired wide, weirdly, as he did often here, so blunt in his shooting you half expected to look down and notice he was playing in flippers. Liverpool were better. Wirtz had a good spell. Chelsea went into random player generator mode, blue shirts hobbling off to the recycling plant to be broken down into parts and sent out again as João Philly-Cheese-Steak, promising non-specific defensive utility shield. Cody Gakpo got the equaliser. Chelsea came on strong at the end. Reece James was supreme, in full defensive warrior mode. And Chelsea deserved to win overall. Liverpool looked muddled, albeit still groaning with talent and trapped energy. It is surely good for the league Liverpool are not top of the table in this state, that it isn’t possible to simply restock your attacking silos and march on seamlessly, that the reactions of your opponents are more nuanced. The question remains. Are they now in crisis? Again, not the worst kind. There is a huge depth of talent to be explored. But there are also creaking parts. Right-back is a problem. Right-back refers pain into the midfield. Wirtz has affected the attacking balance, also the space behind him. This is like a combination boiler where a buildup of flange in your dredge capacitor is causing overheated trex to enter the z-bend via the shuffle valve. Separately, and dating back to last season, Salah has dropped off a cliff. He was fouled a lot here, bounced up, but also couldn’t assert his own energy. He has three goals in 21 games in the league from open play. He isn’t the problem. But he also isn’t the solution right now. This is not quite a crisis. But it is an opportunity for Arsenal, for the rest of the field. And for Slot too, to find answers to the tactical misfires, to fix this team on the hoof. Liverpool are a rejig away from looking like a very potent attacking team, if not perhaps a totally solid one. It feels at least, as we had into anther two-week international embalmment, as though the league is really starting in earnest."
"Salah and Isak will click, insists Slot after Liverpool slip to third defeat",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/04/salah-and-isak-will-click-says-slot-after-liverpool-slip-to-third-defeat,"Arne Slot insisted that Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak would develop an understanding in attack, speaking after Liverpool’s stoppage-time defeat by Chelsea meant they relinquished top spot to Arsenal. Salah and Isak were disappointing as the champions fell to their third successive defeat in all competitions but Slot is confident that his big-name forwards will improve once they get to know each other. “The more they play together the more they will connect,” the Liverpool manager said. “You have to work really hard to reach a certain level and then it’s very hard in football because you also play against very good teams to keep that level going. What I mean by that is consistency. But it’s clear that we had our changes in the summer. Players came in different moments. “Last week there’s hardly been any training time. Still we need to try to bring these players in. If the result would have been better today with a draw or a win then we would have had a great start to the season if you take into account everything that happened in the summer in Liverpool.” Slot, who had to rejig his defence after Ibrahima Konaté went off with a thigh injury in the second half, defended Salah’s wayward finishing. “What I like is that we brought him many times in the position he would like to be in,” the Dutchman said. “And I would like him to be in because he’s shown in his career and since I’m here that in those positions he can score goals. “He had many opportunities to do what he’s done so often. He’s a human being and it’s not like every chance he gets is always a goal. We feel sometimes it is because of what he’s done last season.” Liverpool host Manchester United after the international break and Slot believes better finishing would have stopped his side from losing at Chelsea and Crystal Palace. “In both games we’ve created more chances than the team we have faced but the truth is that we have only scored once in both games and our opponent has scored twice,” he said. Chelsea led through Moisés Caicedo’s early goal and it seemed they would have to settle for a point when Cody Gakpo equalised. But Enzo Maresca’s side moved up to sixth when Estêvão Willian, the Brazilian teenager, popped up in the 95th minute to score his first goal in English football. Estêvão’s intervention sparked wild scenes and led to Maresca receiving a second yellow card for his celebrations. Chelsea’s head coach will serve a touchline ban when his team visit Nottingham Forest. Willy Caballero, Maresca’s assistant, was left to conduct post-match media duties. “He’s OK,” Caballero said of Maresca. “He cannot be here because of the red card. He wanted me to praise the players because of the effort they have done today. We deserved the victory because of the chances we created.”"
Blackpool sack Steve Bruce after one year in charge of League One club,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/04/blackpool-sack-steve-bruce-after-one-year-in-charge-of-league-one-club,"Blackpool have sacked Steve Bruce after a poor start to the League One season, a year after the veteran manager took over at Bloomfield Road. The 64-year-old, who replaced Neil Critchley in September 2024, led Blackpool to a ninth-place finish last season, but Saturday’s 2-0 home defeat by AFC Wimbledon was their seventh loss in 11 league games, leaving them second bottom. Bruce was subjected to boos and chants from disgruntled home fans during the defeat at Bloomfield Road, after later told BBC Radio Lancashire that his side were “nowhere near what’s required … I can try and make as many excuses as I want but it’s not in my nature to do it … I need to take responsibility.” Bruce’s assistant, Steve Agnew, and his first-team coach, Stephen Clemence, have also left the club, with Stephen Dobbie and Steve Banks taking over on an interim basis until Bruce’s permanent successor is appointed. Blackpool, who travel to seventh-placed Stockport next weekend, said in a statement: “The club would like to thank them for their efforts, and wishes them the very best for the future.”"
The secrets of Glasner’s success and why Palace system would be lost in translation elsewhere,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/04/crystal-palace-oliver-glasner-secrets-success-tactics-manchester-united,"Some fixtures just don’t sound right. Maybe it’s just about conceivable that, had things gone slightly differently in the 70s, Malcolm Allison or Terry Venables could have been leading their side behind the Iron Curtain for a crack at Valeriy Lobanovskyi’s cybernauts, but Dynamo Kyiv against Crystal Palace is still a clash that provokes a double-take. It feels like a category error: how can those two clubs possibly be in the same competition? But this is the modern world. Ukraine is battling invasion, its teams diminished. The Premier League is extremely rich. And Crystal Palace are managed by one of the rising talents of the European game. They didn’t just play each other on Thursday, but Palace won with a degree of comfort. It was their third straight win, their 19th consecutive game without defeat. And so, because no mid-size club can even just be allowed to enjoy a good run, all the talk is of where Oliver Glasner might go next. His contract expires at the end of the season and he has refused to sign an extension. He is 51; if he is going to take over a major club with the possibility of an extended spell in charge, he doesn’t have a huge amount of time to secure a move. Could he then be the solution for Manchester United? He does, after all, play the same 3-4-2-1 as Ruben Amorim, just rather more successfully. Which raises the question of why a system that has drawn so much scepticism at United works so well at Palace. But it’s never just about the formation, nor is it the case – within reason – that one formation is intrinsically better than another. Rather certain formations, in combination with the style they are enacted, prioritise certain elements of play. It is, at the very least, intriguing that since Harry Catterick’s Everton won the championship in 1962-63 with a W-M, only one side has won the English league title playing with a back three: Antonio Conte’s Chelsea in 2016-17. Even that was something of a black swan event. Chelsea that season had no European football, keeping them fresher than their rivals, and they had players who suited the formation almost freakishly well. N’Golo Kanté, with his stamina and reading of the game, is almost two players, and he was operating at the back of midfield alongside either the calming presence of Nemanja Matic or Cesc Fàbregas, one of the most incisive passers of the ball the Premier League has known. That provided the platform for the two No 10s: Eden Hazard, who revelled in his free role, and Pedro, a master of the dart into the box. Each of those players was enhanced by their combination with the others. To an extent, the relative lack of success for the back three, at least in terms of winning titles, is cultural. Not many sides have won the league playing a back three because not many sides have played a back three. The World Cup win in 1966 reified in the English football consciousness the effectiveness of zonal marking with a back four. That remained the default, almost without challenge, for the two decades that followed. But there may also be more specific tactical reasons. A back three derives its width from the wingbacks; it may be that the extreme hard-running nature of the English game makes the demand on those players too great to be undertaken regularly. But the 3-4-2-1 poses specific challenges. It is solid, offering the trapezoid defensive shape – three central defenders protected by two holders – that is widely recognised as the most effective way to guard against opposition counterattacks. But that is only one phase of the game. If they advance too far from the protection of the three centre‑backs, given the prevalence of formations with a midfield triangle, two central midfielders will tend to be outmanned without support from elsewhere – unless one of them has the exceptional gifts of Kanté. The very stability of that compact 3-2 shape, meanwhile, although an advantage for a side looking to absorb pressure, becomes a potential drawback for a team that seek to take the game to the opposition. Its greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. The blockish nature of the formation, the way the midfield is divided into holders and creators – all No 6s and No 10s in modern parlance, with no No 8s – means that without a player to step between bands there is a risk of predictability; again, Chelsea had the ideal player to do that, David Luiz often striding forward from the back three to become an additional midfield option. Palace don’t care about that. They have the second-lowest possession of any side in the Premier League. It’s not their job to have the ball. And that’s the main reason why a direct comparison with United’s struggles is difficult. United, by history and by expectation, cannot be the side with the second-lowest possession in the Premier League. Even if United chose to counterattack against other elite sides, most of their games will be against opponents who sit deep and would be happy enough with a draw. In most games there is an onus on them to dominate the ball. Perhaps a progressive team can play a 3-4-2-1 but it requires very particular players – as Conte had at Chelsea. Glasner’s success with it has come at Lask, Wolfsburg and Eintracht Frankfurt, where he has been able to have his side sit deep and break at pace. Palace have beaten West Ham and Aston Villa, because most sides do at the moment, frustrated Chelsea, and torn Liverpool apart on the counter. But they’ve also drawn at home to Nottingham Forest and Sunderland, and struggled to beat Fredrikstad. Sit deep against Palace and they struggle for creativity. Could Glasner adapt were he to go to United? Probably. He has been successful in three different countries; he has proved himself adaptable. But it’s unlikely he could do so playing a 3-4-2-1 in the way he does at Palace, or, being frank, with the current United squad. He may be the manager who made Crystal Palace beating Dynamo Kyiv seem normal, almost expected, but he’s not a miracle worker."
Chelsea 2-1 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/oct/04/chelsea-v-liverpool-premier-league-live-score-updates,"That’s all folks. I’ll leave you with Jacob Steinberg’s report from Stamford Bridge. Moises Caicedo’s reaction It was fantastic [to win it so late] and we are so happy. Everybody knows Liverpool are a fantastic team. We were so good at the end. [In adversity] you have to be even closer and we have been working so hard every day. [On his goal] God is perfect, everything is for him. I had the opportunity to shoot and I did it! When I shot I knew it was going in. It was a fantastic feeling. [Is the win even more special because you could have joined Liverpool?] No, no. It was a great goal but it’s nothing against Liverpool. I’m enjoying it here and doing well, that’s the important thing. Marc Cucurella’s reaction In general I think we deserved the win. We’ve had a tough week so this moment was amazing. We scored early, started to gain confidence and overall it was a very good game. [On the impact of Chelsea’s defensive injuries] It’s not easy but it’s not an excuse – we have the quality, we play for a big team and we showed that today. [On Chelsea targeting Liverpool’s right side] Salah is always ready to counter-attack so the manager told us the space could be there. Today it worked. [On Estevao] He came into the game with a lot of personality. [Jorrel] Hato as well came on when there was lot of intensity and a lot of transitions. I think these two players deserve this game; they showed their equality. Moises Caicedo’s screamer was his third goal of the Premier League season, which puts him joint fifth in the race (sic) for the golden boot. The updated Premier League table Liverpool have lost three in a row, two of them to injury-time goals, but Chelsea deserve so much credit for their performance. They had to survive more injuries and a very rocky period after Cody Gakpo’s equaliser, but composed themselves and were the better team in a ding-dong finish. The Brazilian teenager Estevao was a constant threat after coming on in the 75th minute and settled the match with an injury-time winner. He cannot stop smiling as he walks round the pitch saluting the Chelsea fans. That’s it! A quite brilliant victory for injury-ravaged Chelsea! 90+7 min Enzo Maresca was given a second yellow card for that celebration. I assume/hope he could not care less. Estevao has made such a difference since coming on in the second half. Enzo Fernandez guided a simple pass into the area for Cucurella, who swept a superb first-time cross on the turn towards the far post. Robertson was slightly on his heels – details, details – and Estevao forced the ball into the net from a tight angle. Estevao has scored and Enzo Maresca is charging down the touchline to join the celebrations! Szoboszlai feeds the ball infield from the right towards Ekitike. His brilliant dummy allows the ball to run through to Jones, who moves into the area but blasts wide from a tightish angle. Decent chance. 90+3 min Estevao has a chance to put Fernandez through on goal but overhits what looked a fairly routine pass. 90+2 min There are seven minutes of added time by the way. Chelsea come so close to nicking a winner. Estevao, who has had a big impact from the bench, curls a superb inswinging cross to the far post, where Fernandez gets the run on Szoboszlai, six yards out, and slams a header off the outside of the post. If anything Fernandez was moving too fast. By the time the ball arrived he had to lean slightly away from goal to meet it. 90 min Liverpool break from the resulting Chelsea corner. Eventually Szoboszlai drives a few yards wide from distance; a decent effort but Sanchez was never in trouble. 89 min Szoboszlai makes a vital recovery tackle on Gittens, who would otherwise have been through on goal after terrific play from Hato and Lavia; then Caicedo swishes a shot from 25 yards that is touched over the bar by Mamardashvili. A comfortable enough save that time. 86 min: Liverpool substitution Endo replaces Alexis Mac Allister. 85 min Estevao plays a short through pass to Guiu, who overruns it slightly and is beaten to the loose ball by Mamardashvili. In Guiu’s defence he was under pressure from a defender so it wasn’t an easy ball to control softly. 84 min Gittens swishes a no-backlift shot from 25 yards that is pushed away to his left by the diving Mamardashvili. Moments later he makes a better save, flying to his right to push round an extravagant curler from Estevao. You’d expect a keeper of Mamardashvili’s quality to stop both shots but the second save in particular was good. 83 min “Madonna?!” says Peter Oh. “What, is she a True Blue?” 82 min Arne Slot is booked for complaining about an unpunished challenge on Gakpo. 81 min At the other end Wirtz (I think) and then Szoboszlai have shots blocked. This won’t finish 1-1. 80 min: Chelsea go close A very dangerous low cross from Gittens is stabbed just wide of the far post by Gravenberch, who was facing his own goal and felt he had to go for the ball. 79 min Szoboszlai is booked for a strange hack at Cucurella. It looked bad live, but replays showed he booted the ball off Cucurella and then collided with him in his follow through. Oh well, it’s done now. 78 min Chelsea were rocking for a while but they’re having a better spell now. It’s anyone’s game. 76 min Estevao’s fast cross from a narrow position is met by Guiu, whose header is blocked at source. Lavia then wins a corner on the right. Chelsea take it short and eventually Estevao wins another corner. 75 min: Triple substitution for Chelsea Marc Guiu, Jamie Gittens and Estevao replace Joao Pedro, Pedro Neto and Alejandro Garnacho. 74 min: Liverpool substitution Hugo Ekitike replaces Alexander Isak, who had a quiet game but made Gakpo’s equaliser with a fluky/magnificent touch. 73 min Now Isak goes down holding his face in the Chelsea area after a challenge with James. It looked like a handoff, nothing more, and Isak probably fouled James first. No sanction, and in fact that’s Isak’s last touch of the match. 72 min Turns out Madonna (no relation) is in the crowd at Stamford Bridge. “What’s she eating?” says Gary Neville for some reason. 71 min Gakpo lays the ball back lovingly towards the onrushing Mac Allister, whose sizzling shot from distance is blocked by James. Chelsea, without six centre-backs now, are hanging. 70 min Neto goes down off the ball after a collision with Mac Allister. No idea what happened but Neto is holding his face as play continues. VAR have cleared it. 68 min: Chelsea substitution This is bonkers. Chelsea have lost another centre-back, the teenager Josh Acheampong, to injury. Jorrel Hato replaces him. 66 min Salah curls wastefully high and wide after another good Liverpool break. He was offside so it wouldn’t have counted, but it was another unusually poor effort. 65 min Now Liverpool are going for the kill, pinning Chelsea in their half as Arne Slot roars encouragement from the touchline. Liverpool’s desperation pays off. Szoboszlai’s deflected cross from the byline drops towards Isak, who cushions the ball flukily/ingeniously around the corner towards the onrushing Gakpo. He gets there first, ahead of Gusto, and wallops the ball past Sanchez from close range. If Isak meant that assist, it was a touch of borderline genius. 62 min Liverpool are playing with a desperation usually reserved for the last 10 or 15 minutes. Not sure whether that’s a good or bad thing but it’s certainly noticeable. Chelsea look increasingly dangerous in transition, so maybe it’s not a good thing. A wicked inswinging cross from Neto just evades the man at the far post, Garnacho I presumably. Szoboszlai did enough to put him off. 59 min The impressive Garnacho moves infield from the left, then reverses a pass to the overlapping Cucurella. He stands up a deep cross to Neto, whose header hits Robertson and goes behind. In the circumstances – one point from three league games, injuries galore – Chelsea have been terrific today. 58 min Sanchez drives an outstanding long pass out to Garnacho on the left. He leaves Szoboszlai for dust and slides a low ball that goes right across the face of the Liverpool goal. Just before that, an animated Reece James was showing his shinpad/sock to Anthony Taylor in reference to a challenge from Gakpo (I think) a couple of minutes later. We’ve not seen a replay but there was no suggestion of VAR involvement. 57 min “Last season the pundits claimed it was a dull title race,” says Tim Woods. “This year we decide to give the others a sporting chance and they moan about that as well! Honestly, there’s no pleasing some people. Oh, and Darwin Nunez would have buried that Isak header. As would Andy Carroll.” I offer you Michael Gordon Harford. 56 min: Liverpool substitutions Andy Robertson and Curtis Jones replace Milos Kerkez and Ibrahima Konate. Those subs mean we have to unlikely back fours on the field. Chelsea Gusto, James, Acheampong, Cucurella. Liverpool Szoboszlai, Gravenberch, Van Dijk, Robertson. 55 min: Chelsea substitution Benoit Badiashile limps off to be replaced by Romeo Lavia. Malo Gusto will move to right back and Reece James to centre back. 54 min Badiashile is down and needs treatment. Chelsea are already without four centre-backs so this isn’t exactly what Enzo Maresca needs. 53 min Salah runs onto a long pass down the right, then veers infield with intent. He runs across the line of the penalty area, beats Badiashile but curls high and wide. 52 min At the other end Joao Pedro has a long-range shot blocked by a defender. 51 min Gravenberch has a pop from 22 yards. It’s well struck but straight at Sanchez who holds on securely. 49 min Liverpool have started the second half with greater urgency, as you’d expect. Chelsea respond with a longish spell of possession designed to lower the heart rate of the game. Wirtz almost makes an equaliser with his first touch. Gakpo played a slightly imprecise square pass to Wirtz, who improvised brilliantly to flick it behind his standing leg and put Salah through on goal. Salah shot wide of the near post under pressure. That chance came 18 seconds into the second half. 46 min Peep peep! Chelsea get the second half under way. Liverpool substitution Florian Wirtz replaces Conor Bradley, who was booked and looked a bit vulnerable against Alejandro Garnacho. That means Dominik Szoboszlai will move to right-back. Half-time reading Chelsea lead at Stamford Bridge through a heatseeker from Moises Caicedo, and for large parts of the the first half they were in control against a disjointed opponent. A Liverpool response may be forthcoming in the second half. 45 min Bradley, who has been booked, fouls the lively Garnacho. Careful now. There will be two minutes of added time. A warning to Chelsea. Salah waves a majestic cross with the outside of the boot that clears Acheampong and is headed over the bar by Isak, 10 yards out. Not a sitter but any means for Isak, but a decent opportunity. 43 min Although Chelsea have been the better team, we shouldn’t overstate their dominance – the only shot on target at either end was Caicedo’s spectacular goal. 40 min Szoboszlai took a bit of a risk but there wasn’t enough contact to justify a penalty, and certainly not for VAR to suggest overturning the original decision. Garnacho escapes Szoboszlai in the penalty area, then goes over after a slight touch on the back. Anthony Taylor says no penalty and VAR supports the decision. Enzo Maresca is booked for his protests. 38 min Chelsea take the resulting corner short before working an intricate passing move. Eventually Cucurella tees up Garnacho, who curls a shot just wide from the edge of the area. Mamardashvili didn’t move. 37 min A superb run from Neto ends with a low cross that is turned behind for a corner by the off balance Konate. 36 min Acheampong makes an emphatic tackle on Isak just inside his own half, then strides all the way to the edge of the Liverpool area before trying a pass that is blocked. He’s started excellently. 34 min Bradley is booked for pulling back Cucurella. 33 min Gakpo threads an excellent pass to find Kerkez in the area. He tries to find Salah at the far post and Cucurella boots the ball clear. That was probably the best option for Kerkez, though he could have taken a shot himself from a tight angle. 32 min Liverpool have no rhythm at all in possession. They’re really struggling. 27 min Salah moves promisingly into the area, only to run straight into Enzo Fernandez. Weird to say this about a player of Salah’s ability and mental strength, but he needs a goal for his confidence. 26 min A free-kick from Neto is headed away as far as Gusto, whose mishit volley from 25 yards is blocked. Neto then swings in a cross that is claimed with authority by Mamardashvili. 23 min Liverpool have been a bit scruffy since the goal, that Szoboszlai chance notwithstanding, and Chelsea are enjoying plenty of possession 20 min “I fear David Hindle is inadvertently disproving his own point,” says Matt Dony. “Suarez played well enough, but only scored four goals in his first half season (after arriving in January), and only 11 league goals in his first full season. (He did hit the post an improbable number of times, though. I think he set a record!) “It was only really after a year at Liverpool he became the force of nature we knew and loved(!). Wirtz isn’t personally responsible for the insane price tag. He has plenty of time to adjust and come good. I’d say Slot has earned an awful lot of trust and patience with fans.” I’ll defer to your superior everything but I remember thinking during the 3-1 win over Man Utd, maybe six weeks after he signed, that Suarez might be touched with genius. But the broader point is you could make a helluvan XI out of players who struggled early on after making a big-money move. Gakpo surges into the area in the inside-left channel and cuts the ball back carefully towards Szoboszlai eight yards out. He opens his body to sidefoot a first-time shot that is crucially blocked by Badiashile. 17 min Mac Allister was also partially at fault for the goal. He tried to nick a short pass from Gusto to Caicedo, couldn’t quite get to it and that allowed Caicedo to move into the space he had vacated. Details, details. Moises Caicedo has given Chelsea the lead with a roof-raiser. It came, sort of, from an error by Mamaradashvili, who received an awkward pass from Van Dijk and played a loose return ball that Van Dijk could only chest out of play for a throw-in. Chelsea recycled possession and quickly moved the ball forward to Caicedo. He lost Mac Allister, ran at a backpedalling defence and arrowed a shot into the top corner from 22 yards. Mamardashvili got a slight touch, diving to his right, but in truth he did well to manage that. It was a screamer. Pick that blighter out! 10 min Nothing to report so far with Giorgi Mamardashvili. He was pressed very early on, in his own six-yard box, but looked unperturbed and passed the ball calmly across to Conor Bradley. If Euro 2024 is anything to go by, Mamardashvili is disgustingly overqualified for the job of back-up goalkeeper. 8 min Kerkez wins the first corner of the game for Liverpool. Gakpo clips it in, Sanchez muffs his punch and the ball runs across the area to safety. The referee had blown for a foul on Sanchez anyway. 6 min Gusto fails to control Badiashile’s angled pass over the top after making a good run off the ball. Mac Allister was getting back anyway and Gusto might have been offside. 5 min A fairly cagey start. Liverpool have had more of the ball but there’s nothing in it really. 2 min Chelsea have started with Reece James at right-back and Malo Gusto in midfield, which is a bit of a surprise. This is their revised line-up. Chelsea (4-2-3-1ish) Sanchez; James, Acheampong, Badiashile, Cucurella; Gusto, Caicedo; Neto, Enzo, Garnacho; Joao Pedro. 1 min Peep peep! Liverpool kick off from left to right as we watch. “The problem with ‘but he’s a nice guy’ (Wirtz) is that he is also a very expensive footballer and has to produce on the field,” writes David Hindle. “Luis Suarez, splutter, cough, splutter, was not most people’s definition of a charmer. But he produced a heck of a lot of goals, and took to the game in England like a duck to water. If you gave fans the choice right now....well, you know which way it would go.” He’s been there two months though. Remember Thierry Henry’s first two months at Arsenal? We’ve all gone mad. Arsenal beat West Ham 2-0 at the Emirates to move above Liverpool, at least for a couple of hours. This is how the Premier League table looks right here, right now. And Enzo Maresca’s It’s nice [to play Liverpool]. It’s a chance to learn and we’ve prepared as best we can. [On Chelsea’s injuries] Nine players are unfortunately out, plus we have two or three players [who are carrying injuries*] We will try to find solutions and hopefully we can have a good day – for us and for the fans. * Including Moises Caicedo and Joao Pedro. Arne Slot’s pre-match thoughts [On Giorgi Mamardashvili’s Premier League debut] In the last two games, Ali [Alisson] was involved more than I would like. Giorgi did very well against Southampton so it’s not his first start for us – he’s an experienced goalkeeper and he’s in a good place. [On the inclusion of Cody Gakpo ahead of Florian Wirtz] We have a lot of games, and you see around the world that teams have to change one or two players. Then before the game starts you try to decide what is the best fit for that particular player. You can’t compare the playing style of Chelsea with the playing style of Crystal Palace. “On the subject of Florian Wirtz, for anyone who hasn’t seen, Sky has just posted a lovely collection of interviews with some of his former friends and coaches,” writes Maximilian Sanderson. “Here in Germany he is loved and memed in almost equal measure (the latter affectionately so, and mostly thanks to his viral potato ranking video during the Euros), so I didn’t fully know what to expect, but he seems like a genuinely decent guy with a good support network around him. He might not be starting tonight but I reckon it won’t be long before the goals start to flow...” If he’s so good, why didn’t he score 44 goals in his first five games? Eh? A Liverpool fan writes “Having spent nearly f-o-u-r hours making the one-hour journey to my mother-in-law’s, I’m not in the best of moods,” chirps Matt Dony. “Thanks, M4 closures. Big help. Nothing quite like crawling through Port Talbot at below walking pace. “Anyway. If this was last year, I’d have been fairly confident. Well, not confident exactly. I don’t think I’ve ever been genuinely confident before a football match. But I’d have been a lot more relaxed than I am now. The late goals have been tremendous fun, but wildly unsustainable. The performances have had their moments, but we’re still in the waiting-to-click phase. “You never wish ill on players, but I’m relieved to be facing Chelsea minus Cole Palmer. Even so, I’m not counting on still being top of the league in a few hours time. And on Wirtz being benched; It’s the earliest of early days. He’s an astonishingly talented footballer, and I liked everything I saw of him last season. Still, I can’t help but remember watching Naby Keita tear it up for Leipzig…” On Wirtz, the Pires Principle dictates that any judgement on creative players who are new to English football should be deferred until their second season. Emphasis on ‘should’, because there is overwhelming evidence to suggest we’ve all gone completely mad. Has Arne Slot taken Liverpool as far as he can? Cause and effect latest The teenager Josh Acheampong replaces the suspended Trevoh Chalobah in the Chelsea defence. That’s one of four changes from the side that started last weekend’s 3-1 defeat at home to Brighton. Benoit Badiashile, Malo Gusto and Alejandro Garnacho come in for Jarrel Hato, Andrey Santos (who is injured) and Estevao. That means Reece James is likely to start in midfield. Giorgi Mamardashvili, who was probably the best goalkeeper at Euro 2024, deputises for the injured Alisson. Arene Slot makes one other change, with Cody Gakpo preferred to Florian Wirtz in attack. Wirtz is part of a formidable Liverpool subs bench. Chelsea (4-2-3-1) Sanchez; Gusto, Acheampong, Badiashile, Cucurella; James, Caicedo; Neto, Enzo, Garnacho; Joao Pedro. Substitutes: Jorgensen, Slonina, Hato, Lavia, Emenalo, Buonanotte, Estevao, Gittens, Guiu. Liverpool (4-3-3) Mamardashvili; Bradley, Konate, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Szoboszlai, Gravenberch, Mac Allister; Salah, Isak, Gakpo. Substitutes: Woodman, Gomez, Endo, Wirtz, Chiesa, Jones, Ekitike, Robertson, Frimpong. Referee Anthony Taylor. The world champions meet the English champions at Stamford Bridge tonight, but nobody will be talking about the glories of the recent past. Chelsea and Liverpool are both in contention for the Premier League Crisis Baton™ – passed each week to the team that a hysterical media deems to be in crisis – after suffering a dip in form towards the end of September. Chelsea have taken only one point from their last three Premier League games. Liverpool have lost their last two in all competitions and didn’t even play that well in the seven straight wins before that. In times of trouble, tough games are a mixed blessing. Enzo Maresca and Arne Slot know that, if they win tonight, the negative chatter will stop just like that. But if they lose, the external noise will be amplified. Kick off 5.30pm."
Chelsea’s Estêvão stuns Liverpool with last-gasp winner to leave Arsenal top,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/04/chelsea-liverpool-premier-league-match-report,"There has been so much discussion about Chelsea’s youthful indiscipline but in the end it was one of the kids who made a 45-year-old man lose control. It was a wild finale, Liverpool run ragged, and when Estevão Willian delivered the decisive blow deep into stoppage time it was the cue for Enzo Maresca to leave his technical area, charge down the touchline and join the mass of blue shirts as they celebrated in front of the disbelieving supporters in the Matthew Harding Stand. Liverpool were beaten, their knack for late shows turned against them for the second successive weekend, and it is unlikely that Maresca cared when Anthony Taylor showed him a second yellow card. Call it the sweetest sending off of the Italian’s managerial career. Nobody will be casting doubt over his job security now. Not after witnessing the world champions make light of a recent stumble and an extensive injury list by producing a performance of grit and style to ensure that Liverpool ended a dreadful week with their third consecutive defeat in all competitions. If it feels premature to call it a crisis, it is certainly true that Liverpool must act quickly to reverse their slump. The response to looking up rather than down for the first time under Arne Slot will be fascinating. Do the champions rally after losing top spot to Arsenal or do they fall into a decline reminiscent of Manchester City’s struggles last season? The positive is that Slot is not the type to panic. Dissecting this defeat, the Dutchman pointed to the changes Liverpool went through in the summer. He was adamant that the misfiring duo of Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak will eventually develop an understanding. At the moment, though, the connections are lacking. Liverpool are suspect defensively, the void left by Trent Alexander-Arnold’s departure at right-back has not been filled, the midfield is too open and there was not enough concerted pressure on a Chelsea back four that contained three full-backs by full time. Isak did collect an assist midway through the second half, albeit with a heavy touch for Cody Gakpo to cancel out Moisés Caicedo’s stunning opener, but otherwise it was a listless display from the £125m striker. As for Salah, his shooting accuracy has rarely been worse. All of the forward’s efforts went off target, although he was not alone in suffering. Liverpool struggled as a collective. Maresca’s tactics outfoxed Slot in the first half and Chelsea’s bench also made a huge difference during the last 15 minutes. Estêvão, the Brazilian sensation, had sparkled after coming on and was threatening to decide the game even before he popped up with his first goal since joining from Palmeiras. But one of Chelsea’s best win under Maresca was not about individuals. This was a team effort. The unfamiliar central defensive partnership of Benoît Badiashile and Josh Acheampong excelled before being disrupted when both cramped up. Caicedo and Enzo Fernández fought through fatigue to impress in midfield. Reece James was strong at right-back, then solid when he had to slot in at centre-back. Alejandro Garnacho, dangerous on the left, forced Slot to take Conor Bradley off at half-time. Systemic cracks remained apparent. Bradley was unnerved by Garnacho’s willingness to run behind him, Ibrahima Konaté and Virgil van Dijk were iffy and there were some nervy early touches from Giorgi Mamardashvili, making his league debut in goal because of Alisson’s absence. Little worked for Liverpool. Salah wasted opportunities to release Isak and there were structural problems in midfield, caused by Maresca’s decision to put Malo Gusto rather than Reece James next to Caicedo and Fernández. Gusto was an energetic, highly effective pest. The Frenchman stuck to Alexis Mac Allister, preventing the Argentinian from instigating the buildup, and even made the opening goal when a quick ball round the corner to Caicedo exposed gaps in Liverpool’s setup in the 14th minute. There was so much space for Caicedo that for a moment he looked unsure what to do with it. But when Van Dijk backed off there was only path to take. Caicedo delivered, ripping a screamer past Mamardashvili from 25 yards. A special goal to enliven a mundane half. Chelsea played it carefully, sitting back and launching counterattacks. Maresca had to be pleased when he saw Ryan Gravenberch misplacing passes. The one scare came from Salah crossing for Isak to head over but Chelsea looked strong and might even have had a penalty when Dominik Szoboszlai tangled with Garnacho. Maresca being booked for his furious appeal was not the best look given that his young side keep getting red cards. Chelsea needed to maintain their composure. They wanted a second yellow for Bradley when the right-back fouled Garnacho. Taylor’s leniency allowed Slot to bring Florian Wirtz on for Bradley at half-time and task Szoboszlai with dealing with Garnacho. Wirtz was immediately involved, releasing Salah, who shot wide. Chelsea fell back. Badiashile went off for Roméo Lavia. Acheampong made way for Jorrel Hato, another 19-year-old. Liverpool also had problems. Konaté limping off saw Gravenberch drop into defence. The level of Liverpool’s play was low. They were level when Szoboszlai’s deflected cross reached Isak, whose attempt to turn and shoot became the perfect assist for Gakpo, who arrived to beat Robert Sánchez. Chelsea, though, were defiant. They found a second wind when Maresca brought on Estêvão, Jamie Gittens and Marc Guiu. Estevão and Gittens went close. Fernández headed against a post from an Estevão cross. No matter. Chelsea roared back. Marc Cucurella delivered a low ball, Andy Robertson fell asleep at the far post, Estevão slid in to score, Maresca set off on his run and Slot was left wondering whether his big rebuild is going to click."
"Manchester United are ‘100% behind’ Ruben Amorim, insists Mason Mount",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/04/mason-mount-ruben-amorim-manchester-united-sunderland-premier-league,"Mason Mount has said Manchester United’s players are “100% behind” Ruben Amorim after their 2-0 victory against Sunderland. United’s third win of the season was secured thanks to goals from Mount and Benjamin Sesko, to give Amorim some respite with his future under scrutiny. United have now won three in a row at Old Trafford and also secured a first clean sheet of the campaign. United will travel to Liverpool after the international break, seeking consecutive wins under their Portuguese head coach for the first time. “We’re 100% behind the gaffer,” Mount told BBC Sport. “We’ve had some results that hurt us – the team, the staff and the fans – but that was important today. “We thought after Chelsea it would be the start of something and then we go to Brentford and have a disappointing result. It starts today and we’ll be working hard over the break. We want to get back-to-back wins, then three in a row and push on for the top four.” Amorim called on his players to show that support in the weeks ahead. “I saw today and I know they want to do the best and I know they don’t want to change the coach all the time,” he said, “but, like I said this week, being with the manager is: ‘I will kill myself to do anything in every transition.’ We need to show with actions. “Sometimes when we look at our team I know for sure that they know sometimes we can do better. We need to show it on the pitch, not just at home, but also abroad.” Amorim was rewarded for starting Mount and gave a debut to Senne Lammens. The goalkeeper joined from Royal Antwerp on deadline day for €21m (£18.3m) but had been left on the bench until Sunderland’s visit. “He looks confident in the first game,” Amorim said. “But the important thing is that the teammates helped Senne to have a good game because everyone was focused, not a lot of mistakes.” Asked why he waited to give Lammens a first start, Amorim said: “When Senne arrived here, first of all Altay [Bayindir] was playing and then he arrives and you can feel it. He needs to adapt, new country, new training, the pressure you guys put on the goalkeeper was massive, so it was a little preparation for him to be ready to start his first game. “But it is just one game and he needs to work, he needs to be prepared that in our club things are really hard, but he did well and again he was comfortable during the game. That’s a really good sign.”"
Martin Ødegaard injury takes shine off Arsenal’s victory over West Ham,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/04/martin-degaard-injury-takes-shine-off-arsenals-victory-over-west-ham,"Mikel Arteta is concerned about Martin Ødegaard’s knee injury after the captain limped out of Arsenal’s 2-0 win over West Ham as they kept up the pressure on Liverpool at the top of the Premier League. The Norwegian left the Emirates Stadium with his left knee in a brace after being taken off following a clash with Crysencio Summerville before the break. Declan Rice also had to be withdrawn in the second half with a back injury after he opened the scoring against his former club, with the England midfielder a doubt for the games against Wales on Thursday and Latvia a week on Tuesday. But it was the condition of Ødegaard – who became the first player in Premier League history to be substituted in three successive matches before half-time, having previously been withdrawn against Leeds and Nottingham Forest because of a shoulder injury – that is worrying the Arsenal manager the most. “He had a clash knee-to-knee, and immediately he was uncomfortable,” said Arteta, who marked his 300th game in charge with a comfortable victory. “I just spoke to him, he’s not positive about it, he’s got a brace on. We’ll have to wait and see from the doctors. “We haven’t had him since the start of the season for one reason or the other, the shoulder twice and then this injury. We’ll find solutions, but obviously he’s our captain and is a player that gives us a completely different dimension with the things that he can do, especially in attacking. Let’s wait, and hopefully it’s not that bad.” On Rice, he added: “He’s not all right because he asked me to come off, so that’s a shame. He had pain in his back and he could not carry on, which is something very unusual for Declan, so we’ll have to assess him and see how he is.” Arsenal had lost their two previous meetings with West Ham at the Emirates but Bukayo Saka, who scored a penalty in the second half to make the points safe on his 200th Premier League appearance, said they were determined to make up for that. “It showed the progress we have made,” he said. “The last two seasons we slipped up at home against West Ham and we wanted to put that right today. We know the quality we have at the top end of the pitch and we know if we keep a clean sheet it is more than likely we will win the game.” Nuno Espírito Santo was taking charge of his second match for West Ham since succeeding Graham Potter and the east London club remain in the relegation zone after this defeat. The former Forest manager acknowledged that there is plenty of work to do over the international break. “This week has been a lot of new challenges, new things, a lot of changes,” he said. “I think the international break is going to be very useful in terms of settling down the mind and focus, but all the aspects of the game we have to address.”"
"Arsenal 2-0 West Ham, Manchester United 2-0 Sunderland, and more: football clockwatch – as it happened",https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/oct/04/arsenal-v-west-ham-manchester-united-v-sunderland-and-more-football-live-clockwatch-score-updates,"Right, here you can find the latest tables ahead of the early evening kick-off and with that I’m signing off. I’ll be shutting things down here on clockwatch quite soon, but we have a cracker in the 5.30pm (BST) kick-off Stamford Bridge with Liverpool in town. Follow along with Rob Smyth: An interesting email from Joshua Keeling: United fan here. Still behind Amorim, 100%. At some point you have to accept the manager is not the biggest problem. He is trying to sort out the culture of the club, get rid of problem players, and rebuild. He seems to have the resilience and charisma to do the job without it crushing him. It was always going to take more than one transfer window for his style of play to bear fruit. We knew he was committed to this formation when we appointed him, and we need to let him get the players to play it properly. Plus there have been signs of improvement this season. Yes, it’s one step forward and two steps back at times, but there has been enough there to suggest he deserves more time. This win will keep the wolves from the door for a little while longer, but this result needs to be backed up against better teams than Sunderland. Thomas Frank, speaking after Tottenham’s 2-1 win at Leeds, has said it is “about time” match winner Mohammed Kudus scored. “I’m pleased for Mo to get his goal and it was about time, and I’m so happy for Mathys as well,” said Frank. “The character he has shown as a young man from day one has really impressed me after the setback of not being in the Champions League squad. He trains well and was ready today.” More reaction from the Spurs boss here: Ruben Amorim will be pleased the only storm Manchester United had to navigate was provided by the skies. The head coach witnessed a rare comfortable victory against Sunderland to alleviate the pressure on him for a fortnight at least. Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko scored their first home Premier League goals for the club, although having joined two years apart, it indicates some of the problems Amorim has been dealing with. Apart from a brief scare on a penalty that never was, life was straightforward for United as they secured a third win and first cleansheet of the season amid downpours and gales but, like the Old Trafford roof, the hosts did their job. Read Will Unwin’s full report from Old Trafford: So much for bogey teams. In a week that Mikel Arteta’s side have banished the demons of their poor recent record at Newcastle and here against Olympiakos, it was West Ham’s turn to feel the force of a resurgent Arsenal as they laid down the gauntlet in the title race with a convincing victory. Other than the concerning sight of first Martin Ødegaard and then opening goalscorer Declan Rice having to be replaced due to injuries, this was a most satisfying afternoon for Arteta on his 300th match in charge. While 16% of Arsenal’s goals under the Spaniard have come from set-pieces – a figure only surpassed by Tony Pulis and Sam Allardyce of those who have managed that many games in the Premier League – they showed they are still capable of breaking down teams who come to defend with a low block as well.

QPR have come from a goal down to lead against Bristol City, it’s 2-1 to the visitors at Ashton Gate. Leciester are now 3-1 up against Swansea, Jannik Vestergaard has all-but sewn up the win. 80 mins: Manchester United 2-0 Sunderland Lammens hasn’t had to make a proper save on his debut but Sunderland have given it a go in the second half. Mayenda the latest to try his luck, firing over from the edge of he box. He’s brought down a minute or two later and Casemiro goes into the book. 81 mins: Arsenal 2-0 West Ham The visitors are yet to have a shot on target, very timid performance. 79 mins: Arsenal 2-0 West Ham Merino and Martinelli have replaced Rice and Eze. 76 mins Manchester United 2-0 Sunderland Granit Xhaka goes into the book for bringing down substitute Matheus Cunha. Kobbie Mainoo is on for Mbeumo. Leicester are back in front against Swansea, it’s 2-1 to the visitors at the Swansea.com Stadium and Preston are 2-0 up at home against Charlton. 75 mins: Arsenal 2-0 West Ham More changes at the Emirates as Ethan Nwaneri and Miles Lewis-Skelly on for Trossard and Calafiori. Chelsea XI: Sanchez, Gusto, Acheampong, Badiashile, Cucurella, Caicedo, James, Pedro Neto, Fernandez, Garnacho, Joao Pedro.

Full-time scores from the Bundesliga Augsburg 3-1 Wolfsburg Bayer Leverkusen 2-0 Union Berlin Borussia Dortmund 1-1 RB Leipzig Werder Bremen 1-0 St. Pauli In League One, Stevenage are set to go top of the table, they lead 2-0 against Luton. Swansea were trailing at the break but have now levelled from the spot, Adam Ihah converting a penalty. Millwall are now 3-0 up against West Brom. Absolute cracker in League One between Leyton Orient and Cardiff, it’s seen multiple lead changes and the Welsh side currently lead 4-3! The VAR had a look and Diouf’s foul was adjudged to be in just inside the area. Saka’s penalty is emphatic, right into the top corner. 64 mins: Arsenal 1-0 West Ham Penalty for Arsenal, was that in the box? 60 mins: Manchester United 2-0 Sunderland It’s a triple change for Sunderland, Chemsdine Talbi, Eliezer Mayenda and Brian Brobbey replace Wilson Isidor, Arthur Masuaku and Bertrand Traore. 58 mins: Arsenal 1-0 West Ham Changes for the Irons, Magassa and Füllkrug go off, with Freddie Potts and Callum Marshall coming on. 56 mins: Arsenal 1-0 West Ham Crysencio Summerville is booked for a foul on Bukayo Saka, the Arsenal man has been taking a few kicks. 55 mins: Manchester United 2-0 Sunderland Sesko is linking up really nicely with Mbeumo. The big man holds up the ball and plays a nice pass around the corner to Mbeumo, who drives into the box but fires well over. Dortmund are pushing for a winner against Leipzig but that one is still 1-1. I’ll have a full run-through of full-times from the Bundesliga shortly. In the Championship, Millwall have doubled their lead against West Brom thanks to Femi Azeez. 53 mins: Arsenal 1-0 West Ham It’s all Arsenal here. Trossard is in the thick of it, he gets to the byline by ghosting past Aaron Wan-Bissaka but Mavrapanos gets over to block his shot out for a corner. 51 mins: Arsenal 1-0 West Ham I haven’t typed the words Viktor Gyökeres yet today, largely because he’s done nothing and he’s still yet to do anything. He has chance to poke in a second from Rice’s excellent low ball across goal but the Swedish striker’s stretch isn’t stretchy enough. He has to get there. 47 mins: Arsenal 1-0 West Ham There’s a quick VAR check for an Arsenal penalty but that’s not going to be given, the ball flicked a West Ham defender’s arm from very close range. Play is back underway at the Emirates and Old Trafford. A new low of Sheffield Wednesday in the early kick-off at Hillsborough as Coventry swaggered into town and left with a 5-0 victory amid onfield protests against Owls owner Dejphon Chansiri. A group of home supporters entered the pitch and caused play to be stopped for ten minutes. Full report here: Barnet 1-0 Accrington Stanley Barrow 0-0 Shrewsbury Bromley 2-1 Tranmere Rovers Cambridge United 1-0 Crawley Cheltenham Town 0-0 Fleetwood Colchester 4- Chesterfield Notts County 2-0 Oldham Salford 0-2 Grimsby Walsall 0-1 Bristol Rovers Blackpool 0-1 AFC Wimbledon Bolton 2-1 Peterborough Cardiff City 1-1 Leyton Orient Huddersfield 0-1 Stockport County Lincoln 0-0 Exeter City Plymouth Argyle 0-0 Wigan Port Vale 0-0 Northampton Reading 0-1 Mansfield Stevenage 0-0 Luton Bristol City 1-0 QPR Derby County 1-1 Southampton Millwall 1-0 West Brom Portsmouth 1-0 Middlesbrough Preston 0-0 Charlton Swansea 0-1 Leicester Watford 2-1 Oxford Loads of action at Old Trafford and United have had the best of it. The best performance of the season for Amorim’s side. Arsenal nearly get a second just before the break as Riccardo Calafiori’s hits the post with a low strike, it hit the back of Areola before being hooked clear. West Ham will be hoping to carry more of a threat after the break. 45+3 mins: Manchester United 2-0 Sunderland VAR penalty review! Stuart Atwell is sent to the screen for a high foot in the box by Sesko on Trai Hume but the referee sticks with his onfield decision. That’s a big call but it doesn’t look like there was any contact. Sunderland get a corner, not a penalty and from that Daniel Balllard has to score at the back post but misses with his header. DRAMA! I missed this earlier, but Yang Min-Hyeok has put Portsmouth ahead against Championship leaders Middlesbrough and the hosts have made it through to half-time 1-0 up. 45 mins: Arsenal 1-0 West Ham Now they have the lead Arsenal are taking the sting out of this one. It’s a lot of easy possession on halfway with West Ham camped out deep. 44 mins Manchester United 2-0 Sunderland Tactics Tim on Sky is ranting about systems. He’s getting very excited United are going long to Sesko and Mount is picking up the second balls. What an odd perversion. Derby have levelled at home against Southampton, Patrick Agyemang scoring that one. In Italy, Scotland international Che Adams has equalised for Torino at the Stadio Olimpico to make it 2-2 against Lazio. This has been coming. Rice shows Eze how it’s done as he converts a loose ball when it falls his way on the penalty spot after Areola turned away Saka’s initial shot. That was harder to control than it looked. 35 mins Arsenal 0-0 West Ham Saka hits the deck and there is a moment of concern, he’s not crocked too is he? He’s fine. The West Ham box is facing a barrage as the hosts stack set-pieces, so far Areola is holding firm. A couple of League Two updates to bring you, Grimsby are winning 2-0 at Salford and Bristol Rovers are 1-0 up at Walsall, good news for Swindon who won earlier and currently sit on top of the league. That’s two in two for the big man as he gets on the end of a flick on from a long-throw. Route one is back. 29 mins: Arsenal 0-0 West Ham Odegaard has gone down again. He tried to play on but couldn’t and Zubimendi is now on for the Arsenal skipper. 25 mins: Manchester United 1-0 Sunderland Big save from Roefs to deny Bruno Fernandes, tipping the shot on to the post, and Amad should put in the rebound but misses the target with his header on the follow-up. The changes appear to have worked from Amorim. 24 mins: Arsenal 0-0 West Ham Goal disallowed! Rice plays in Saka with a lofted pass that pierces the West Ham defence, it’s well-finished but the winger had gone early. 22 mins: Manchester United 1-0 Sunderland Amad bursts into the box after carrying the ball from near halfway and stings the palms of Roefs. 21 mins: Arsenal 0-0 West Ham Concern for Arsenal and the fun-time midfield could be broken up early. Odegaard took a knock in a challenge with Summerville and he’s had lengthy treatment on it. It would be a blow if the skipper has to go off. Jake Cooper has put Millwall ahead against West Brom. It’s 1-0 to the home side at the Den. 18 mins: Arsenal 0-0 West Ham Nuno looks pensieve on the touchline but West Ham have started pretty well all things considered. Arsenal have had the best chance but the visitors look pretty well organised. We have another goal in the Championship, Jordan James has put Leicester 1-0 ahead at Swansea. Ernest Poku has broken the deadlock at the BayerArena, Leverkusen lead 1-0. 12 mins: Arsenal 0-0 West Ham Saka is slipped in by Odegaard and there’s a scramble in front of the goal from the winger’s cut back, it falls to Eze on the six yard line and he tamely volleys over. That was a huge chance and a baffling miss. 10 mins: Arsenal 0-0 West Ham A break in play with a West Ham player down for treatment, Mavrapanos looks like he’s taken a knock just above the eye. He’s being patched up like a boxer between rounds, bit of Vaseline above the eye. Bryan Mbeumo picks out Mason Mount in the box and the (former?) England international takes a great first chance before beating Robin Roefs in the Sunderland goal. Championship strugglers Oxford are ahead at Watford, thanks to a Max Alleyne own goal. Southampton are leading at Derby, Adam Armstrong with the goal. 3 min: Manchester United 0-0 Sunderland Chance for Bertrand Traoré to give Sunderland the lead but he can’t take it and that’s a big let-off. 1 min: Arsenal 0-0 West Ham Early test for David Raya as West Ham get the games first corner after a Niclas Füllkrug chance. No issues for the Arsenal defence. We are underway! The teams are out at the Emirates and Old Trafford, kick-off soon. At Signal Iduna Park, Yan Couto has equalised for Borussia Dortmund. Bayer Leverkusen v Union Berlin is the only game without a goal now in the Bundesliga, Samuel Mbangula has Werder Bremen ahead against St Pauli. Much was made of Tottenham’s propensity to capitulate last season, resulting in their worst Premier League campaign and Ange Postecoglou’s dismissal, but here was further evidence of the new chapter being patiently written by Thomas Frank. Facing a Leeds side buoyed up an encouraging start to the season and a typically vociferous home crowd, Spurs might have buckled in this kind of encounter last term. In filthy conditions they stood their ground to maintain their upward trajectory. How very un-Spursy. Tottenham are evolving just nicely this season and made their class tell with goals from Mathys Tel and Mohammed Kudus either side of a first-half equaliser from the Leeds winger Noah Okafor. Read Ross Heppenstall’s full report from Elland Road via the link below: We’re coming up to half-time in Serie A’s early games, Lazio are currently beating Torino 2-1 and Lecce lead 1-0 at Parma. Championship Blackburn Rovers 1-1 Stoke Hull 1-0 Sheffield United Sheffield Wednesday 0-5 Coventry League One Doncaster Rovers 1-1 Burton Albion Wycombe Wanderers 2-2 Barnsley League Two MK Dons 3-2 Gillingham Newport County 0-1 Swindon Nuno believes West Ham can turn season around Nuno Espírito Santo has said West Ham’s players are willing to change and have taken responsibility for the team’s poor form of the past 18 months. “I find a nice group of people,” Nuno said. “They are starting to realise that we have to change things. If we don’t change, things will be the same. They are willing to change. I can see it. So let’s embrace it and let’s change it. “It goes from technical, tactical, physical, mentality, respect, communication. Communication is such an important tool for us. We still don’t have it fully. It has to be a fair and clear communication that we share. They have accounted themselves responsible and are willing to go.” More of Nuno’s pre-match thoughts here: Borussia Dortmund are undefeated in the league so far this season but have fallen behind at home agaist RB Leipzig, Christoph Baumgartner has put the visitors ahead. In Germany we have four matches underway now and Augsburg have taken an early lead against Wolfsburg. It’s full-time at Elland Road and Mohammed Kudus’ second-half goal proves to be the difference. I’ll drop the report from Leeds as soon as I have it. Time to be brave: the tactical tweaks Amorim needs to make at Manchester United Daniel Harris suggests five changes the beleaguered United manager could make in order to turn his ailing team around. Tom Garry has filed from Eastlands, here’s his report from City’s 3-2 win over Arsenal: In my preamble I said Boro would likely need a win to go back to the top of the Championship. Coventry were 2-0 up at that point, they are now beating Sheffield Wednesday 5-0 with a few minutes remaining. Frank Lampard knows what he’s doing in the Championship. Mikel Arteta has decided West Ham are the team to unleash his fun-time midfield aganst. Eberechi Eze, Martin Odegaard and Declan Rice all start. Mikel Merino and Martín Zubimendi are sacrificed in the name of adventure. The high point of Graham Potter’s West Ham tenure came at the Emirates last season, can Nuno exploit this Arsenal team? Amorim has made five changes from the 3-1 defeat at Brentford. The most notable of those is Senne Lammens making his debut in goal. Three games on the bench is enough time to get a grasp of the job between the sticks for this United side, it seems. Mason Mount, Casemiro, Amad Diallo and Leny Yoro are all picked to start as Altay Bayındır, Matheus Cunha, Harry Maguire, Patrick Dorgu and Manuel Ugarte pay the price for their roles in the loss at the Gtech. The magnitude of Sunderland’s visit to Old Trafford for Ruben Amorim’s future is not up for debate. Amorim always said a storm would come and the driving rain is providing from the skies, he needs a win, to stop it coming on the pitch. The Manchester United head coach has failed to turn things around in his 11 months in charge of the club and another defeat, especially one to a promoted team, would be incredibly damaging going into the international break. There are reports of Amorim’s general unhappiness but he will not want to leave prematurely. Admittedly, his record of securing 34 points in 33 Premier League games in charge is dismal, the sort that would put United in a relegation battle. Whenever the odd green shoot of hope emerges at United, it is quickly stamped out. The Chelsea victory was followed by breezily succumbing to Brentford the following week with a performance of ineptitude. Everyone from the boardroom to the Stratford End is eager for the Portuguese to succeed but, equally, this can’t go on much longer. Amorim, despite the problems in midfield, seems unable to find a role for Kobbie Mainoo in central midfield. The academy graduate is a natural footballer but Amorim feels the experience of Casemiro or chasing of shadows Manuel Ugarte are better options alongside Bruno Fernandes. A more flexible coach would realise Mainoo has the potential to be the future of the club but that is not the attitude offered. Sunderland, on the other hand, are thriving. They had a very busy summer but Regis Le Bris has managed to create a cohesive unit. Having come up through the playoffs, everyone expected them to go straight back down but through comprehensive recruitment and good coaching, they are showing the potential to defy the odds. As ever, you can send in your thoughts via the link at the top of the page or below the line. It’s all over at the Joie Stadium where Manchester City have beaten Arsenal in the WSL. Billy Munday has live reaction here: Obviously I would love for you to stick around with me but we do have live action in the Premier League, with Leeds hosting Spurs. Scott Murray has that one: Arsenal XI: Raya, Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori, Rice, Eze, Odegaard; Saka, Gyokeres, Trossard. Subs: Kepa, White, Lewis-Skelly, Mosquera, Norgaard, Zubimendi, Merino, Nwaneri, Martinelli. West Ham XI: Areola, Wan-Bissaka, Mavropanos, Kilman, Diouf, Magassa, Fernandes, Bowen, Paqueta, Summerville, Fullkrug. Subs: Hermansen, Walker-Peters, Igor, Wilson, Guilherme, Rodriguez, Scarles, Potts, Marshall. Manchester United XI: Lammens, Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw, Amad, Casemiro, Fernandes, Dalot, Mbeumo, Mount, Sesko. Subs: Bayindir, Dorgu, Heaven, Leon, Maguire, Mainoo, Ugarte, Cunha, Zirkzee. Sunderland XI: Roefs, Hume, Mukiele, Alderete, Masuaku, Le Fée, Xhaka, Sadiki, Traoré, Isidor, Adingra. Subs: Patterson, Ballard, Geertruida, Neil, Rigg, O’Nien, Talbi, Brobbey, Mayenda. A whopping two 3pm (BST) kick-offs in the Premier League has me questioning what’s happened to this country. At least they are two games with plenty of intrigue. West Ham make a trip on the Overground from Stratford to Highbury and Islington (because all players live at the stadiums they play in) for Nuno Espírito Santo’s second game in charge of the Hammers. Arsenal got a straightforward win in midweek and look built to last. Given Nuno’s preference for pragmatism and Arteta’s priorities usually being control over creativity, this could be a low-scoring affair. That will probably hinge on whether or not West Ham can get to grips with the home side’s set-pieces. Will the clown show continue at Old Trafford as high-flying Sunderland take on lowly Manchester United? Ruben Amorim’s dogmatic thought experiment in 3-5-2 looks increasingly like it is on its last legs, another defeat would surely prompt another round of high-level discussions from the Ineos brains trust. Sunderland put the (black) cat amongst the pigeons at the City Ground last weekend and have gone about their return to the Premier League with much more purpose than other promoted clubs in the last few seasons Elsewhere, Middlesbrough will probably need a win at Portsmouth to return to the top of the Championship as Coventry are currently leading at Sheffield Wednesday. Bristol City v QPR is another fixture that catches the eye in the Championship. There’s an intribung Herts-Beds clash in League One where Stevenage host Luton, with the home side able to jump past Bradford to take over top spot with a win. In League Two, Walsall and Salford will be looking to move up the table with the early pacemakers, Gillingham and Swindon, currently in action. Further afield, I’ll also be keeping an eye on Borrussia Dortmund’s clash with RB Leipzig."
Sesko eases pressure on Amorim as Manchester United avoid Sunderland slip,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/04/manchester-united-sunderland-premier-league-match-report,"Ruben Amorim will be pleased the only storm Manchester United had to navigate was provided by the skies. The head coach witnessed a rare comfortable victory against Sunderland to alleviate the pressure on him for a fortnight at least. Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko scored their first home Premier League goals for the club, although, having joined two years apart, that indicates some of the problems Amorim has been dealing with. Apart from a brief scare on a penalty that never was, life was straightforward for United as they secured a third win and first clean sheet of the season amid downpours and gales but, like the Old Trafford roof, the hosts did their job. Amorim has spent much of his tenure being criticised for an unwillingness to change his 3-4-3 formation. He led a passionate defence of his style and system at his Friday press conference, claiming it is not the issue. The same cannot be said of the personnel, leading to five changes from losing at Brentford, including a debut for the goalkeeper Senne Lammens, who was untroubled throughout. When Bertrand Traoré failed to convert a simple chance in the opening minutes, there was concern that United were facing another very unpleasant afternoon. Good news came Amorim’s way in the ninth minute when one of his changes paid off. Bryan Mbeumo chipped the ball into the box, where Mount was waiting, taking a touch before carefully placing a shot into the corner. The Old Trafford nerves were calmed. Mount is one of Amorim’s most trusted players thanks to intelligence and work rate. He often dropped deeper to help out Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro in central midfield when Sunderland had possession as United overwhelmed the visitors in a key area of the pitch. Amid a deluge there was the rare sense that United were enjoying themselves. A second was sought, focusing on play down the right. The former Sunderland loanee Amad Diallo and Mbeumo tested Robin Roefs with almost identical curling shots. Little was learned about Lemmens but he looked calm and assured when required. At the other end, Roefs was proving once again why he is one of the signings of the summer. Fernandes took precise aim for the top corner and expected to be celebrating a split second later, only for a stunning fingertip save on to the bar from the Sunderland goalkeeper. It was a simple set piece that did the trick. A long Diogo Dalot throw-in was flicked on by a Sunderland defender and Sesko was alert to net his second in as many games, allowing him to embrace the Old Trafford adulation. “This [scoring at Old Trafford] has been the moment I’ve dreamed about as a kid, because the atmosphere here is unbelievable,” Sesko said. The Black Cats carried out an impromptu investigation on where it had all gone wrong. There was plenty of finger-pointing but it did not improve the defending as the same almost happened again soon after. Things were going so badly for Sunderland, Régis Le Bris brought off Simon Adingra in the 37th minute, replacing the winger with the centre-back Dan Ballard, in an attempt to interrupt United’s dominance. Passes were zipping around and Sesko looked comfortable as the focal point of the attack. The intensity and cohesion Amorim desires on a weekly basis was on show. Mbeumo and Diallo repeatedly combined down the United right, to give hope of a blossoming relationship, while Mount had arguably his best game for the club. Lemmens was even given a huge cheer for making his first catch of the match, to give him a confidence boost. The two-goal lead felt comfortable but that did not completely remove the jeopardy. Stuart Attwell awarded a first-half stoppage-time penalty, believing Sesko had kicked Trai Hume in the head while attempting to clear a throw-in. The referee was wrong – although it was strange the striker thought it sensible to have his boot so high – and overturned his original decision on review. Scares and opportunities were rare after the break, as United showed resilience and control, even if the excitement levels dipped. United’s players will now disperse for international duty and Amorim will be hoping the prospect of building momentum does not leave with them. When they return, United face a trip to the champions Liverpool, ensuring the prospect of first-back-to-back wins under Amorim will be difficult but he can plan for that task in peace."
Saka sends Arsenal top with victory over West Ham in Arteta’s 300th game,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/04/arsenal-west-ham-premier-league-match-report,"So much for bogey teams. In a week they have banished the demons of their poor recent record at Newcastle and here against Olympiakos, it was West Ham’s turn to feel the force of a resurgent Arsenal as they went to the top of the Premier League after Liverpool suffered a second straight defeat. Other than the concerning sight of first Martin Ødegaard and then Declan Rice, scorer of the first goal, having to be replaced because of injuries, this was a most satisfying afternoon for Mikel Arteta on his 300th match in charge. While 16% of Arsenal’s goals under the Spaniard have come from set pieces – a figure surpassed only by Tony Pulis and Sam Allardyce of those who have managed that many games in the Premier League – they showed they are still capable of breaking down teams who come to defend with a low block as well. West Ham, who had won onpast two trips here, initially put up a fight under their new manager, Nuno Espírito Santo, but were not able to respond after falling behind to the outstanding Rice against his former club. The England midfielder asked to be substituted in the second half clutching his back after the equally influential Bukayo Saka had made sure of the points with a penalty. It was with the memory of February’s damaging defeat here that ended a 15-match unbeaten run and any realistic hopes of catching Liverpool that probably persuaded Arteta to start with Rice as a single pivot in midfield with Ødegaard and Eberechi Eze ahead of him. But the experiment did not last long as the Norwegian was forced off on the half-hour mark, with his replacement, Martín Zubimendi, allowing Rice to push further forward. West Ham made the more positive start when Niclas Füllkrug headed over a corner inside the first minute. Nuno opted for a mobile midfield three of Matheus Fernandes, Soungoutou Magassa and Lucas Paquetá that caused Arsenal’s defence some more problems early on after Jurriën Timber had tested Alphonse Areola at the other end. Eze, who has the dubious honour of having had the most shots without scoring in the Premier League this season, then ballooned his 17th over from six yards when the French goalkeeper spilled the ball on the line in a moment he will want to forget. The sight of Ødegaard having to limp off on the half-hour mark after hurting his knee in an ill-judged attempt to tackle Crysencio Summerville was not exactly what Arteta would have had planned either. But while Viktor Gyökeres was unable to convert a brilliant cross from Saka that skimmed off the big striker’s head as Arsenal stepped up the pressure, it was Zubimendi who helped unlock the visitors’ creaking defence. Eze’s shot after being played in by the Spaniard was pushed straight into the path of Rice and he did well to keep his follow-up down. “Declan Rice, we got him half-price,” sang the Arsenal supporters, with the England midfielder not celebrating, but instead taking a lingering glance at the away end that had earlier barracked him as he took a corner. West Ham were just happy to hold until the break as Arsenal – and the outstanding Saka in particular up against the raw Senegal defender El Hadji Malick Diouf – smelled blood. Areola was fortunate Riccardo Calafiori’s shot that hit him after cannoning off the post did not trickle back over the line. Gyökeres was inches away from converting Leandro Trossard’s cross as Arsenal picked up where they left off. There is more of an intensity about their attacking this season with Rice so often the driving force from deep. West Ham could not get out of their own half and Nuno’s response was to replace Füllkrug and Magassa for the 20-year-old striker Callum Marshall for his debut and academy graduate Freddie Potts in midfield. It seemed only a matter of time until Arsenal doubled their lead, although they were fortunate that the referee, John Brookes, deemed Diouf’s challenge on Timber to have taken place inside the area and pointed to the spot, with Saka making no mistake."
Thomas Frank says it was ‘about time’ Mohammed Kudus scored for Spurs,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/04/thomas-frank-mohammed-kudus-tottenham-leeds-premier-league,"Thomas Frank admitted it was “about time” Mohammed Kudus scored after his second-half strike earned Tottenham a 2-1 victory at Leeds. The £55m summer signing had not found the net in nine games but his deflected 57th-minute shot sealed an impressive win. Kudus also provided the assist for the opener by Mathys Tel, who notched his first of the campaign, but Noah Okafor levelled for Leeds before Kudus’s strike proved decisive. “I’m pleased for Mo to get his goal and it was about time, and I’m so happy for Mathys as well,” said Frank. “The character he has shown as a young man from day one has really impressed me after the setback of not being in the Champions League squad. He trains well and was ready today.” Victory lifted Spurs up to second before the remainder of Saturday’s other Premier League matches after they began the day in fifth and continued their impressive start under the former Brentford manager, this their fourth league win under Frank. Tottenham might well have buckled in this kind of game last season, when they endured their worst Premier League campaign, resulting in Ange Postecoglou’s sacking. Spurs have won three of their opening four away Premier League games this season, which is as many as in their final 13 away league games of last season under the Australian. Frank added: “I’m extremely happy with the win. If you want to build any successful team, you need mentality, character, cohesion and togetherness no matter if you play like Inter or Barcelona. Whatever the style of play, you need that willingness to do everything to win and I think we’re building that more and more in the team. “We created two goals and other very dangerous situations and chances, so of course I’m delighted with the start we’ve made. Fourteen points in seven games – averaging two points per game – is very good and I’m extremely happy that on the road we have won three and drawn one. It’s a good start, but we need to continue.” His Leeds counterpart, Daniel Farke, cut a frustrated figure as his side lost at home in the league for the first time in more than a year. But the German also took the positives, especially as Spurs were left hanging on at the end with Guglielmo Vicario’s fine save denying Joël Piroe a stoppage-time equaliser. “We have to take our chances and hope the goalkeeper is not the man of the match, but we should have hit the target with a few of our chances,” Farke said. “Still, we played one of the country’s top sides and were the better side. That’s encouraging and I’m proud of how far we have come.” Leeds fans were angry at referee Thomas Bramall’s officiating, but Farke insisted: “I have to be a bit careful, I don’t like to comment in public. I leave it with others to comment on the referee, I comment on what I can influence.”"
Leeds United 1-2 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/oct/04/leeds-united-v-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-live,"Ross Heppenstall was at Elland Road, and his report is in. Here it is! Thanks for reading this MBM. Daniel Farke talks to TNT Sports. “First impressions … disappointed … but if you put the result to the side … we were the better side today in all aspects … we dominated … gutted for them that we didn’t win anything … one or two mistakes we were punished … after one or two days the boys can be proud … deflected strikes … their goalkeeper was man of the match probably … football is sometimes like this … the lads should be proud of their performance … against such a good side … we can take many positives out of this game … a top performance and an unlucky result … if we deliver this performance I’m sure we will be fine in the end.” Thomas Frank – who has won against Daniel Farke for the first time – speaks to TNT Sports. “Huge respect for Leeds and Elland Road and Daniel … they haven’t lost in more than a year at home … so we knew it would be difficult … our performance was good offensively … scored some good goals … good situations … kept Leeds at a minimum … until the 80th minute, when it was a little bit carnage and we needed a couple of saves from Vicario … the mentality and character is the major foundation if you want to achieve great things … there are so many difficult opponents … there will be so many setbacks in games … you need to relentlessly keep going … that’s the core of any great team … I’m so pleased for [Mathys Tel] … I’m so happy for [Mohammed Kudus] … it was Xavi Simons’ best game … more to come.” Mathys Tel speaks to TNT. “It was a tough game for us, the opponents played very well … we deserved to win … we fought until the end … I worked this week a lot about finishing … so I’m very happy … I will keep going … we work together and win together … that’s what we showed today … we did it for the team and for the fans.” Mohammed Kudus adds: “As an attacker it boosts your confidence to score … big credit to all the team … everyone put a lot of effort … I want to give Mathys big credit … big, big applause to him … I’m a big fan of how he comports himself … I’m happy he’s got his first goal and many more to come … we go to represent our countries and come back with top focus … there are a lot of games and points to fight for.” Tel is then asked to give Kudus his player-of-the-match award … which he does, but only after pretending awhile to keep it for himself. When he does hand it over, the pair laugh heartily and give each other a big hug. A sweet and infectious moment that’s impossible to watch without smiling too. Tottenham are building a team here. That was a fun match, and an impressive performance from Spurs. On TNT Sports, Lucy Ward named Mohammed Kudus as her man of the match, an assessment that’s more than fair, though Xavi Simons staked a claim for the award too. Thomas Frank has got Spurs moving in the right direction again, and this win takes them into second, for a couple of hours at least. Everyone celebrating despite all the rain. Meanwhile it’s more misery for Leeds against Spurs, and they taste defeat in the league at home for the first time in over a year. But they put in a good shift too, and look well equipped to stay in the Premier League. Another day, another Spurs win over Leeds. That’s five in a row now. 90 min +6: Replays show Richarlison treading on Struijk’s foot before the defender fell over. But neither VAR nor referee show any interest in revisiting the incident. You’ve seen them given, but it would have been very soft, and Struijk was on the way down anyway. 90 min +5: … and Struijk goes over, claiming a penalty. But he’s not getting one. Everyone on the Leeds bench up in arms. 90 min +4: … so having said that, Calvert-Lewin wins a header on the edge of the box. It drops to Piroe, who whips a first-time shot towards the bottom right. Vicario turns it around the post. Great play all round, and a big corner coming up. It’s sent into the mixer and Struijk can’t get a header on target from six yards. But it took a flick off Udogie, so another’s about to come in from the left … 90 min +2: Struijk competes for a header in the Leeds box but Danso is in his way, and not giving an inch. Leeds not creating very much and time is running out. 90 min +1: Ampadu flings in a long throw from the right. After some more head tennis, the ball drops to Longstaff, who demonstrates how the stuff Matthew Le Tissier used to make look so easy isn’t that easy. His languid volley disappears into the stand. 90 min: Some head tennis in the Spurs box. Calvert-Lewin wins a header on the edge of the six-yard box, but he’s all over Danso and the whistle goes. Then Kudus is replaced by Johnson. There will be six additional minutes. 89 min: Justin comes on for Bogle. 88 min: … but before Porro takes the corner, he picks up something thrown at him by a fool. The officials aware. Then he hoicks the corner straight out of play. 87 min: Richarlison advances down the right. He scuffs a shot across the face of goal and out of play, but seems it took a nick off Ampadu, so it’ll be a corner for Spurs. Porro to take. 86 min: Harrison tries to find Nmecha with a curled pass down the left, but Vicario reads the danger and comes to the edge of his box to claim. But Leeds come again, Calvert-Lewin hooking around Van de Ven on the byline to keep the ball alive. However all his hard work is for nought, as Bogle turbo-blooters his cross behind the goal. 85 min: Leeds have gone to a back three, pushing more men forward in their desperate search for an equaliser. So Spurs make a defensive change, replacing Odobert with Danso. 83 min: There’s not a lot going on right now, which will suit Spurs just fine. 81 min: Leeds are up against it here, because TNT have just flashed up this stat: Spurs are the only team in the entire Premier League not to have conceded a goal in the last 15 minutes of any match so far this season. 79 min: Now it’s Leeds making a double change. Off go Gudmundsson and Okafor, on come Piroe and Nmecha. 78 min: Bogle strips Richarlison and strides towards the Spurs box. He’s got options either side, but decides to shoot instead. It’s ambitious, which is the best we can say for that. 77 min: Tanaka takes a couple of slick flicks to set Leeds off on the attack, down the inside-right channel. Calvert-Lewin nearly releases Harrison into the box but the latter can’t control. Tanaka has looked lively since coming on. 75 min: Calvert-Lewin comes clattering into Romero, knee up. Not sure whether he’s caught his opponent full in the fruitbowl, or just (!) the chest, but Romero felt that either way. No booking. 73 min: Tel goes down, but gets up quickly enough when he realises he’s being substituted anyway. Simons also departs, with Richarlison and Sarr coming on. 71 min: Tanaka glides in from the left and finds Longstaff in the middle of the park, 25 yards from goal. Longstaff takes up possession and swivels 180, rifling an instant shot inches wide of the bottom-left corner. Not sure Vicario was getting to that had it been on target. Close to a second Leeds equaliser. 69 min: … so having praised Simons, he carelessly ships possession to Harrison, who drives purposefully towards the Spurs box. He lays off to Bogle, who can’t decide whether to cross or shoot, and achieves neither. 67 min: Leeds make a double change, replacing Aaronson and Stach with Harrison and Tanaka. 66 min: Simons has been superb, showcasing his wily stylings from the get-go. He shovels a clever pass down the inside-right channel, releasing Porro into the box. Porro should do better than shanking a dismal effort into the side netting. 64 min: Romero and Okafor tangle horns over some garden-variety nonsense in midfield. A philosophical back-and-forth, nose to nose. It threatens to boil over, but their pals pull them apart. Both go into the book. 63 min: The rain continues to hammer down. For the record, Thomas Frank doesn’t have his hood up either. He’s a fair bit happier than his equally soaked counterpart, though. 61 min: Tottenham suddenly put their foot to the floor, and Elland Road fell a bit quiet as a result. The home crowd rally and find their voice again as Longstaff launches long into the Spurs box, but Rodon can’t keep his header down, the ball sailing harmlessly into the stand behind. 59 min: Spurs come so close to a third, Simons flicking Odobert into space down the left. Udogie fizzes a low drive through the six-yard box that somehow evades both Kudus and Tel. 58 min: Another Spurs goal that’s taken a small flick en route to its destination. This time off the sliding Struijk. To be honest, it was probably going in anyway. Porro sends Kudus scampering down the right. Kudus cuts inside, putting Gudmundsson on his backside. As the defender sprawls, Kudus reaches the right-hand edge of the D, swivels and fires into the bottom right, past the wrong-footed Darlow! 57 min: … but Daniel Farke signally refuses to put up his hood. Steve McClaren has an awful lot to answer for. 56 min: It’s tipping down, by the way. Coming down in stair-rods. 55 min: Porro is thankfully back up, but he’s not happy and telling it as he sees it to anyone who will listen. He is fuming. Kudus takes the resulting free kick and wafts it harmlessly towards the bottom right, where Darlow claims without fuss. 53 min: Ampadu catches Porro late in a 50-50 challenge just outside the Leeds D. Porro felt that, and requires some treatment. Studs on shin. Yellow card, although VAR takes a while to clear the option of a red. There didn’t look to be any malice in it, but it was reckless, and Ampadu couldn’t have complained if he’d got his marching orders. 51 min: Incidentally, that Calvert-Lewin shot was deflected a little bit by Romero’s extended leg, taking the ball further away from Vicario. So that was some save. Let’s give the Spurs keeper, who has made his mistakes this afternoon, fair measure. 49 min: … and then Aaronson whistles a low cross through the six-yard box from the right, Calvert-Lewin inches away from poking home. Had either of those chances gone in, it’d have been nice to hear the trenchant exchange of views between Simons and Romero. 48 min: Tel sends Simons into acres of space down the right. Simons has the opportunity to release Romero, of all people, down the middle, but overeggs the pass, attempting to find his team-mate with a rabona, for goodness sake. Leeds go straight up the other end, Calvert-Lewin spinning and taking a shot towards the bottom right. Vicario sticks out a strong leg to deflect away from danger. 47 min: Porro crosses from the right. Darlow does well to palm the ball away from goal with several Spurs players closing in. “Leeds lack of an on-form striker might still be telling this season. But they’ll take scoring Vicariously today.” Justin Kavanagh the latest of you to channel Peter Oh in this MBM. Leeds get the ball rolling for the second half. No changes. “When I saw the team sheet, I worried about having two of our front three operating with a shortage of confidence and a lack of final product,” begins Matthew Carpenter-Arevalo. “I am glad to see Tel on the score sheet. I hope it represents the start of something. I am old enough to remember the scepticism of Harry Kane when he was coming through, and we’ve seen how that turned out.” More half-time entertainment. A schadenfreude special for Leeds fans. Half-time entertainment. “At Arsenal on Wednesday Daniel Podence, who is 5ft 4in, could be seen actively sprinting away from every set-piece like a guilty husband caught on kiss cam. At one point he leapt for a high ball and it was as if someone had thrown an action man at Ben White from a passing car.” Another day, another Barney Ronay classic. Enjoy, enjoy. Both teams have brought the energy. Both teams have scored. Both teams have hit the woodwork. It’s been a fun game. The scoreline seems about right. 45 min +3: Other than that – a reasonably significant caveat, to be fair – this half is petering out. 45 min +1: The first of four additional minutes passes by … but not without significant incident, as Simons sends Udogie clear down the left with an insouciant flick of the boot. Udogie flip-crosses to Tel, who steers a header towards the top left but off the crossbar. Darlow beaten all ends up. Leeds clear their lines. 45 min: Some more from our man at the ground, Ross Heppenstall. Spurs have threatened to tear Leeds apart at times with some of their incisive counter-attacking football, but the scores are deservedly level. Tottenham have played the silkier football but there is an energy and a physicality about the hosts. Fascinating contest in the West Yorkshire sunshine. 43 min: Incidentally, as Okafor’s shot was heading into the bottom left, a petrol-station-forecourt ball rolled onto the pitch and nearly clanked into the matchball. If Pepe Reina is watching this, he’s permitted one cold shudder down the spine. 41 min: Palhinha isn’t happy about that decision, and absurdly performs the dive mime. The referee does well to keep his counsel, and his cards in his pocket. Palhinha threatening to talk himself into a second yellow and a red card that would register 11 on our patented Ekitike-o-meter®. 40 min: Aaronson dribbles down the right and is unceremoniously flipped into the air by the sliding Palhinha, who goes into the book. 38 min: Okafor whips a cross in from the left. A couple of inches lower and Calvert-Lewin was surely planting a header into the net from six yards. But the ball sails over his head. 37 min: Spurs are suddenly skittish, and Aaronson is able to tee up Longstaff for a speculative shot from distance. The ball sails over the bar. Elland Road is bouncing. 35 min: Okafor, his tail up, makes good down the left but is shouldered to the floor by Udogie. No free kick, for some reason. Daniel Farke not happy. Bogle whips in from the right. Calvert-Lewin, his back to goal, cushions the ball into the road of Aaronson, who slams a shot straight at Vicario. The keeper, who has been poor since the get-go today, parries straight into the path of Okafor, who can’t miss from a couple of yards. The leveller! 33 min: Tel and Longstaff both require treatment for knocks. Tel goes off, as per regulations, but Longstaff is allowed to stay on and restart the game with a free kick. Thankfully for folk who tire easily of confected controversy, nothing comes of the set piece, but Leeds come again, and … 31 min: Kudus whips a vicious dipping cross in from the right flank. Odobert, coming in from the left, should slam home from a couple of yards, but clumsily skies it straight into the air, and off Bogle’s arm. Darlow claims. Odobert claims too, for a penalty, but come on and come off it. Bogle was right next to him and knew nowt about it. An egregious miss. 30 min: Calvert-Lewin has been whacked by Van de Ven and is currently walking around in the ginger style. He gives up on a long pass that offered hope. Perhaps he’ll run it off, but penny for the thoughts of any Everton fans. 28 min: Ampadu delaps another throw from the right. Bentancur heads clear. “Tel ya what, that was a beauty!” quips Mary Waltz. “Apologies to Peter Oh.” 27 min: Calvert-Lewin sashays in from the left and blazes over the bar. Big waste. Spurs go up the other end, Udogie in acres down the left. He squares for Kudus, who opens his body and slices wide left when he surely should have scored. Somewhere in a parallel universe, the latest score is 1-2. 25 min: That’s Tel’s first goal of the season, and an answer to a small coterie of critics. Tottenham now need just three more goals to become the first-ever away team to score four goals on three consecutive visits to Elland Road. Bentancur wins the ball in the centre circle. He feeds Kudus down the middle, who shuttles right for Tel, who takes his second and third touches of the game to advance down the channel and take a whack. The ball almost immediately takes a nick off Struijk’s outstretched leg, and spins on an upward trajectory over Darlow and into the top-right corner. 22 min: Kudus comes through the back of Stach’s standing leg. He goes into the book. It wasn’t overly aggressive, but it wasn’t a good challenge either. Orange would have been about right, but he couldn’t have complained too much if the referee flashed red. 21 min: Simons dribbles into the Leeds box from the left and goes over. He doesn’t claim a penalty, and that’s because he’s lost his balance all by himself. The crowd still give him what-for. 19 min: … but it’s a throw, and we’re living in Tony Pulis’s world now. Ampadu launches it long from the right, causing brief confusion in the Spurs defence. But nobody in white can get to the ball and the visitors eventually clear. 18 min: Leeds have been quiet for the last few minutes, but they spring to life again through Okafor and Gudmundsson down the left. A corner is won. It’s swung into the mixer by Longstaff and eyebrowed away from danger by Palhinha. 17 min: Simons finds Udogie in acres again down the left, but the full-back has gone too early and up goes the offside flag. Simons looking almost as sharp as Kudus. 16 min: Simons slips a cute ball down the left channel for Udogie, whose shot-cum-cross is parried clear by Darlow. Palhinha tries again from long range but that’s not happening. Spurs beginning to find their rhythm. 15 min: Kudus steals the ball from Stach and power-glides down the middle of the park. He slips the ball wide left to Odobert, who takes a touch in the hope of setting himself for a shot, but only succeeds in gifting the ball to Bogle, who clears. Kudus is so easy on the eye when he’s in this mood. 13 min: The pace drops for the first time. 11 min: Vicario nearly makes an awful hash of dealing with a simple long ball. Out of his area, he almost accidentally handles while attempting to chest down. He adjusts himself and shepherds the ball back to his box, where he finally deals with the situation. But it’s not been a stellar start for the Spurs keeper. 10 min: Spurs get their foot on the ball for the first time. Kudus with an elegant spin into space. Odobert crosses from the right. Simons cushions the ball back to Palhinha, who blooters a shot over the bar. 8 min: Early days of course, but Leeds have enjoyed 68 percent of possession so far. 7 min: Okafor skips past Kudus on the left touchline with ease and flair. He prepares to zip past Porro too, but the full-back is having none of it, and gets a shoulder in. Free kick. That could be a booking, too. Longstaff sends the set piece towards the far post. Vicario comes off his line and gets nowhere near the ball. Rodon meets the ball with a strong header, but crashes it off the post. With the keeper on walkabout, he probably should have scored. But that’s pretty darn close. 5 min: The corner comes in from the left and falls to Stach on the right-hand edge of the D. Stach volleys but slices horribly wide left. The ball pings off Ampadu’s head en route to the stand, but doesn’t go any nearer to the goal. 4 min: Longstaff and Stach both win 50-50 challenges in midfield to get Leeds on the front foot. Romero thinks Stach has handled the ball, but again the referee lets things flow. The first corner of the game is won. 3 min: A cracking atmosphere at Elland Road, by the way. Like that’s breaking news. One of the great old-school theatres. 2 min: Bogle sends a long pass down the right for Calvert-Lewin, who is skittled to the ground by Van de Ven. You’ve seen free kicks given for much less, but the referee waves play on and the ball sails out for a goal kick. It’s a contact sport, I guess. Spurs get the ball rolling. No wind! No rain! Storm Amy can do one. The teams are out! Noah Butterfield, 3, lost his sight while battling illness but gained a pal in Leeds captain Ethan Ampadu. The pair hold hands as they lead the players onto the pitch. Little Noah in a 1970s smiley hat, the star of the show. Leeds in white, Spurs in black. We’ll be off in a minute. This from our man at the ground! The Guardian, comin’ atcha from all angles. You’re welcome. Twenty minutes before kick-off and it is threatening to turn into a beautiful autumn day at sun-drenched Elland Road, writes our reporter Ross Heppenstall. Archie Gray is on the bench for Spurs but there will be no match-up with his younger brother Harry, 16, who is a nursing a minor hip injury and doesn’t make the Leeds bench. Archie, 19, will hope to make it onto the pitch at some point today to face his boyhood club. He spoke to the Guardian in December 2023 in his first-ever major interview about his career trajectory and hopes and dreams … Daniel Farke talks to TNT. “This is why we were so desperate to be back in the Premier League … to have this type of game … a top side … we know we have to be at our very best today to have a chance to win points … performance-wise I am pleased we have been competitive … it is good not to have to rotate too much … I am pleased with my squad.” Thomas Frank speaks to TNT Sports. “We try to find the balance between consistency and freshness in the team … Richarlison has done two 90 minutes in a row … hopefully [Mathys Tel] will have a good performance today … [Xavi Simons] has been solid with good glimpses … it is a month ago he has arrived … I am happy with what I have seen but there is more to come … all areas need adding layers … solidness and mentality at set pieces has been lifted … creating enough is the next bit … the most difficult thing in football … relationships … we will keep working on it … there has been energy in all of our games … very happy with that … I’m aware this is a difficult place to go … but we are ready.” Leeds drew 2-2 with Bournemouth last weekend. In fact they very nearly beat them. A result that is maturing better than fine wine. Look! As a result, they’re unchanged. Spurs by contrast have made three changes to their starting XI from the 1-1 draw with Wolves last weekend. Mathys Tel, Pedro Porro and Wilson Odobert come in for Richarlison, Lucas Bergvall and Djed Spence, all of whom drop to the bench. Leeds United: Darlow, Bogle, Rodon, Struijk, Gudmundsson, Longstaff, Ampadu, Stach, Aaronson, Calvert-Lewin, Okafor. Subs: Meslier, Piroe, Nmecha, Bijol, Harrison, Tanaka, Bornauw, Justin, Gruev. Tottenham Hotspur: Vicario, Porro, Romero, van de Ven, Udogie, Joao Palhinha, Bentancur, Kudus, Simons, Odobert, Tel. Subs: Kinsky, Danso, Richarlison, Gray, Bergvall, Johnson, Spence, Sarr, Davies. Referee: Thomas Bramall (Sheffield). The team lying fifth plays one sitting comfortably in 12th at the start of play … so given the lack of any significant historical enmity between the two clubs, there can’t be too much jeopardy in this one, can there? Well perhaps not. However. Tottenham have won their last four matches against Leeds, scoring four goals in each of the last three. Widen the focus, and they’ve won nine of the last 11 meetings in the Premier League. If they score another four today, they’ll become the first club in history to notch that number in three consecutive visits to Elland Road. So there’s plenty of pride on the line for Leeds, who will lean on their excellent home form: they’ve gone a full year without losing a league game on their own turf, a run that takes in 23 matches. One sequence or another has to snap today, then. Or maybe both. We’ll find out what’s what from 12.30pm UK time. It’s on!"
Mohammed Kudus keeps his cool as Tottenham show steel to hold off Leeds,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/04/leeds-tottenham-premier-league-match-report,"Much was made of Tottenham’s propensity to capitulate last season, resulting in their worst Premier League campaign and Ange Postecoglou’s dismissal, but here was further evidence of the new chapter being patiently written by Thomas Frank. Facing a Leeds side buoyed by an encouraging start to the season and a typically vociferous home crowd, Spurs might have buckled in this kind of encounter last term. In filthy conditions they stood their ground to maintain their upward trajectory. How very un-Spursy. Tottenham are evolving just nicely under Frank and made their class tell with goals from Mathys Tel and the £55m summer signing Mohammed Kudus – his first for the club – either side of a first-half equaliser from the Leeds winger Noah Okafor. Leeds lacked nothing in spirit, but Spurs showed their class – and no little resilience either. Here they claimed a third victory from four unbeaten away games in the Premier League this season. This was just Leeds’s fourth defeat in 50 league games here since Daniel Farke took charge in the summer of 2023. Granted, the past two seasons were spent in the Championship, but there is something special about the febrile atmosphere created at this vintage stadium. The earlier downpour gave way to beautiful sunshine when the teams emerged and “Marching on Together” was belted out with gusto by the home faithful, including the club legend Eddie Gray in the directors’ box. The man known in these parts as Mr Leeds United was, though, denied the prospect of brothers Archie and Harry Gray, his great-nephews, facing each other. Archie, 19, joined Spurs from Leeds in the summer of 2024 while 16-year-old Harry, who made his senior bow for Leeds in the Championship last term, watched on from the stands with a hip flexor injury denying him any involvement in the match. Archie – whose father, Andy, and grandfather, Frank, also played for Leeds – was among Tottenham’s substitutes, but did not get on. Leeds made a vibrant start. They went agonisingly close in the seventh minute when Anton Stach delivered a deep free-kick and the former Tottenham defender Joe Rodon arrived to head against the outside of a post. Spurs, with Tel picked to start ahead of Richarlison, gradually steadied themselves and João Palhinha sent a fizzing 20-yard shot over the crossbar. The visitors then began to probe intricately and forced Karl Darlow into action in the 15th minute when Xavi Simons’s neat pass found Destiny Udogie advancing inside the left channel. His cross-shot was parried by Darlow and Spurs continued to give the impression they could move through the gears when the opportunities arose – and so it proved in the 23rd minute. Rodrigo Bentancur won possession on halfway and found Kudus, whose neat pass inside the right channel invited Tel to drive at the defence. He hit a fierce right-foot shot that took a deflection off Pascal Struijk and flew past Darlow for his first goal this season. Leeds almost fashioned a swift riposte, but Dominic Calvert-Lewin blazed wildly over the bar from inside the area. They were level, though, in the 34th minute when Brenden Aaronson’s strike was parried by Guglielmo Vicario into the path of Okafor, who tapped home from close range. Chances continued to proliferate at the other end for Tottenham, who were always lively on the counterattack, and on the stroke of half-time Wilson Odobert’s cross was greeted by Tel, whose header hit the bar. That was a let-off for Leeds, who were unchanged for a fourth successive game, but they shaded possession during the first half and almost led shortly after the interval. Calvert-Lewin’s low strike was well saved by Vicario before Stach’s whipped ball across the face of goal failed to find a teammate. Having failed to take their chances, Leeds were punished when Kudus pilfered possession from Gabriel Gudmundsson and cut inside before hitting a low, left-foot shot that again deflected off the unfortunate Struijk and left Darlow flat-footed. Spurs remained dangerous on the break, but Leeds were denied a dramatic equaliser in stoppage time when the substitute Joël Piroe’s shot was superbly tipped around a post by Vicario and Struijk went close moments later with a header."
Newcastle’s Ben Gibson sinks Heidelberg United’s Australia Cup dream,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/04/newcastles-ben-gibson-kills-off-heidelberg-uniteds-australia-cup-dream,"In the end, there was simply no more magic for Heidelberg United Alexander to call upon. After a history-making run to the final of the Australia Cup, John Anastasiadis’s semi-professional outfit fell in a 3-1 extra-time defeat to the Newcastle Jets on Saturday evening, ending their hopes of becoming the first side from outside the A-League Men to lift the trophy and dashing their dreams of playing in next year’s Asian Champions League 2. That honour will instead go to the Novocastrians, who dragged themselves back up off the canvas after falling behind to Ryan Lethlean’s eighth-minute opener to equalise through Max Burgess in the 21st minute. Over 70 minutes later, they forced themselves in front through Oscar Fryer in the 96th, the substitute cutting inside from the right and curling an unsaveable effort inside the far post before sealing the result in the 115th through a super turn and finish from Ben Gibson. Between the two extra time goals, both sides had a player sent off, first Kosta Grozos for the Jets, then Heidelberg’s Johnny Apostolopoulos. While it wasn’t the neutrals’ preferred outcome, the scenes at full time, with the despair of the Heidelberg-dominated 10,000 supporters in attendance at Lakeside Stadium juxtaposed against the rapturous scenes from the visitors, spoke to what lifting the trophy meant to the Jets. Indeed, in pretty much any other year, this triumph would be considered something of a fairytale itself. The side from the Hunter have played finals football just once in the past 15 years and, while their bitter F3 Derby rivals Central Coast were winning trophies, spent much of their past years in a state of existential peril and propped up by the financial support of four fellow A-League sides. Saturday ended a 17-year trophy drought in their first-ever Australia Cup final, earning themselves a first chance to play in Asia themselves and stoking dreams of a turnaround and a bright future under their new ownership and a new coach in Mark Milligan. “For me, it’s for the fans,” said Milligan. “They’ve waited a long time for silverware, waited a long time to be in finals. It’s never easy. It’s extremely difficult to make finals. There’s players, fantastic players, that go through their careers without making a final. “We’ve spoken a lot since I’ve come in that we want the support of the fans, but we have to show [them] who we are. We have to show every day who we are, show every game who we are and what we’re becoming. It’s up to us to repay them, and this is just the start of that.” Romance and sense of occasion aside, an A-League Men side winning out over National Premier League opposition, as had also been the case when Macarthur defeated Sydney United in 2022, was always the most likely outcome. The Jets controlled large sections of the game, with Burgess, looking reborn after his exit from Sydney, pulling the strings in the midfield as he won the Mark Viduka medal as best afield. With their 2025-26 campaign imminent, they were far further into their preseason than fellow professional outfits were when they fell to Heidelberg in the earlier rounds, and the mortgage brokers, tradies, and disability support workers who made up the host’s ranks had to go to extra time in what was their 40th game of the year. Yet while the Jets did have the best of the contest after riding a emotion-charged Heidelberg start and forced Yaren Sözer into a string of impressive saves, it speaks to the level that Anastasiadis has brought this side, as well as the shrinking gap between Australia’s closed top flight and the tiers below more generally, that this was a highly entertaining game and could easily have gone the other way. Not only did the contest go to extra time, but Alexander were a constant threat on the counter, ensuring that they created just as many chances to grab a decisive goal during regular time as the Jets. For both sides, however, the final moment let them down. At times, it appeared as though the sense of occasion and what was riding on the result played a key role in forcing the game to extra time. Asahi Yokokawa, for instance, will be haunted by the moment he broke through one-on-one with James Delianov in the 74th minute, only to opt to chip the keeper and send his effort wide. On any other evening, the Japanese attacker almost certainly attempts to bend his attempt around an onrushing custodian. “We probably ran out of a bit of legs and they put on some fresh youngsters,” said Anastasiadis. “And you know how youngsters are, they just run all day. So it’s a credit to them. Congratulations to Newcastle. It was a good game of football. It had everything. A fantastic crowd, a fantastic spectacle. “I’m proud of my boys … they fought like lions today and unfortunately we just fell a bit short.” Inevitably, amid their pride at defying the odds to reach this stage, missed chances, penalty shouts, and every other kind of what-if will haunt Heidelberg. On another night, this could have been their moment. Saturday, however, was a night for the Jets to dream."
Manchester City 3-2 Arsenal: Women’s Super League – as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/oct/04/manchester-city-v-arsenal-womens-super-league-live-wsl-updates,"That’s all from me. If you want more live football coverage, head over to Tom Bassam’s clockwatch of today’s Premier League action: Tom Garry’s report has landed. It’s good. Read it. Kerstin Casparij speaks to Sky Sports, saying it must have been “quite a fun game to watch”. She is named player of the match after her goal and assist from right-back and said: “We get a lot of freedom in this system and it gives me a lot of opportunities to get forward and attack.” What about a title challenge now? “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves but this was such an important win for us. We are pushing to win the league. But it’s still early days.” After match-winner Iman Beney credits her teammates’ performances, Casparij calls her a “humble queen”. The youngster at least admits: “To score against Arsenal in the last minute, it’s something special.” The home fans are celebrating vigorously because they know what this means. These head-to-head games between the ‘big four’ always seem crucial, come the end of the season, and these are three big points for the hosts. Well, that was fun. Caldentey’s equaliser straight after the break set the tone for a topsy-turvy second half. Casparij’s bundled second was then cancelled out by Kelly’s eye-catching equaliser before Beney, on as a substitute, scored the decisive goal in the 88th minute. Ooh, that will sting for Arsenal. They are now three without a win and five points off the WSL summit. It’s all over! Russo has the final chance of the game but her header from Kelly’s cross is wide. After a seesaw game, Man City go to within one point of WSL leaders Chelsea courtesy of 19-year-old Iman Beney’s late winner. 90+6 min: Catley wins a corner for Arsenal. This is surely their last chance. 90+5 min: Arsenal push forward in search of what would be their third equaliser of the game. 90+4 min: Kelly wins a foul off Shaw in the Arsenal half when really it looked the other way around … 90+3 min: Kelly bumps into Ouahabi, giving City the perfect chance to take the sting out of the play. 90+1 min: City throw on Sydney Lohmann for Blindkilde Brown. 90 min: Six minutes of added time. Plenty of time for another twist. Is that a winner? A long ball is brought down by Shaw, whose pass finds its way to Beney and the finish is hard, low and exactly what City were looking for as Arsenal threatened a winner of their own. 86 min: Arsenal can smell blood now. Yamashita sends a wayward pass out of play and Slegers’s side make camp on the edge of the City box once more. 84 min: Kelly threatens again, sending a low shot just wide from the edge of the box. What a shift in the mood at the Joie Stadium. Just as I was about to say she was struggling to get into the game, Chloe Kelly hauls her team level! The former City winger curls a shot, with the aid of a deflection, into the far corner from the edge of the box! 80 min: Arsenal bring on Frida Maanum, who has three goals to her name this season, for Caldentey. Kyra Cooney-Cross is on as well. Little goes off. 79 min: City get caught on the edge of their own box and Blackstenius fires a warning shot, albeit well over. 78 min: City threaten a third! Fujino finds Shaw in the box and, after her initial pass is blocked, the striker stings the palms of Van Domselaar at her near post. Hasegawa’s inswinging corner is cleared by Arsenal. 75 min: Miedema makes way for Laura Coombs, another former Arsenal player. City needed fresh legs in that midfield. These final 20 minutes feel big for Arsenal. Really big. After they dropped points at home to Aston Villa last time out, they’ll be under pressure if they lose this and they won’t have an easy week, starting the defence of their European title at home to the French giants OL Lyonnes on Tuesday. Renée Slegers looks deep in thought on the touchline. 73 min: Arsenal test Yamashita again from the resulting corner but City survive again. 72 min: Should be 2-2! Rose’s short backpass is pounced on by Blackstenius. The Arsenal striker is one-on-one with Yamashita but loses out, her shot blocked by the City goalkeeper and Greenwood sends the loose ball behind. 70 min: Those substitutions don’t seem to have stopped Arsenal’s momentum. Mead gets the ball out of her feet and tests Yamashita with a low drive from the edge of the area. 68 min: A mostly warm welcome from the City fans for Kelly, whose bitter departure seems to have been largely forgotten. Maybe those heroics in the summer helped. 67 min: Arsenal bring on the big guns. Chloe Kelly, Beth Mead and Stina Blackstenius emerge from the bench. Foord, Smith and Pelova go off. 66 min: McCabe’s free-kick and the resulting Arsenal corner keep City guessing but come to nothing. 64 min: Arsenal swing the tempo of the game back in their favour. Smith wins a foul off Blindkilde Brown on the edge of the box. McCabe will take. 62 min: Van Domselaar makes a crucial save! Shaw gets on the end of another cross and almost doubles City’s lead straight away but the Arsenal goalkeeper is equal to her header. Crikey, this is wide open now. The resulting corner ends up in the back of the Arsenal net! Greenwood picks out Shaw at the back post and Van Domselaar parries her header back out. Casparij is one of a couple of City players tussling for the rebound and she gets enough on the ball to see it over the line. 60 min: Iman Beney has come off the bench for City and is straight into the action. Miedema plays the young Switzerland international in and her shot is deflected into the side netting. 58 min: Smith is a constant threat. A combination with Fox sends her down the right again but the Canadian’s cross is misjudged and drifts towards the opposite corner flag. 57 min: Smith sends a gorgeous pass into Russo with the outside of her boot. The England striker swivels and shoots but her effort is way off target. 55 min: Casparij appears to be the out-ball for City. Anything else they try is being met with an Arsenal challenge or interception. 52 min: Shaw is up and about again, trying to get on the end of a long ball from Rose but Fox deals with the threat. 49 min: Well, whatever Slegers said at half-time has had the desired effect. Arsenal are all over City. They are being physical as well, Catley clattering into Shaw and leaving her on the deck. Jeglertz’s side look shaken. Caldentey is so sharp from kick-off. She opened the scoring inside the first minute of Arsenal’s 4-3 win here last season and now she’s scored within 60 seconds of the restart. Arsenal waste no time in levelling the scores! Fox’s cut-back finds Caldentey inside the penalty area and the Spaniard’s sweeping finish beats Yamashita at her near post. Bunny Shaw gets us under way once more. A reminder of the options available to both teams off the bench: Man City Keating, Layzell, Coombs, Wienroither, Lohmann, Beney, Prior, Thomas, Adedini Arsenal Zinsberger, Reid, Codina, Hinds, Cooney-Cross, Maanum, Mead, Kelly, Blackstenius Charles Antaki writes in with some half-time thoughts: All the Arsenal players look off the pace, except perhaps for Emily Fox, and the absence of Leah Williamson means collywobbles in the centre of the defence. Maybe things will improve when she returns to the team, but in the meantime a lot of players will be getting a serious bit of chat from Slegers at half-time. Lotte Wubben-Moy might be excused for a little rustiness. She’s played just a handful of minutes this season and didn’t get off the bench for England at the Euros (again). This is her first start since April. Shaw is OK and City will be thankful for that. She’s been the outstanding player in this first half and is the scorer of the goal that separates the two teams at the break – a header from Casparij’s cross in the 36th minute. Slegers has some thinking to do now. While her side have been good on the ball and Smith in particular has looked dangerous, they’ve struggled to get to grips with Shaw and Miedema. 45+2 min: Wubben-Moy catches Shaw late and the City striker goes down holding her ankle. Bit of a concern for Jeglertz just before half-time. 45 min: Fujino lets fly from the edge of the area but her shot goes over. Three minutes have been added. 44 min: Foord twists and shoots on the edge of the City box but Yamashita gets down comfortably to gather. Shaw let Arsenal off the hook there. She beat one player too many when it would’ve been easier just to take the shot early. 40 min: Arsenal are rocked! City have the ball in the net again as Casparij flies into space and plays the ball across to Shaw. The Jamaican delays for too long and her shot is eventually blocked, with an offside Casparij tucking the ball home. 38 min: Shaw looks in the mood now. Miedema plays her in behind with a perfectly weighted pass but the flag goes up as the striker goes to round Van Domselaar. It was tight. That’s four goals in five games for Bunny Shaw so far this season. City take the lead! Fujino battles hard down the right and plays a pass to the overlapping Casparij. The right-back’s cross is headed expertly past Van Domselaar by Shaw. 35 min: Shaw gets her head to the corner and a foul is given for a challenge on Yamashita. 34 min: Smith and Foord both fire crosses into the City box as Arsenal try to turn the screw. They have a corner … 31 min: Shaw is released in behind the Arsenal defence but Van Domselaar is there to slide in and clear the ball. There’s definitely space in behind the Gunners’ high line. 30 min: Yamashita is called into action as Pelova feeds Foord and the Australian’s shot is parried by the City goalkeeper. The flag goes up anyway. 28 min: City go close again! Fujino’s cross is met at the back post by Miedema, whose header is saved by Van Domselaar. Clinton can’t force the rebound in either. 26 min: City hit the bar! Van Domselaar scrambles to bat away a corner from underneath her own crossbar and the ball bounces off the top of the woodwork and drops safely behind. It’s been a poor game so far. Both teams’ passing ranges have looked a bit off, and neither goalkeeper has been made to sweat. Compared to last night, when we were treated to end-to-end football between the top two, Manchester United and Chelsea, this one hasn’t come to life quite yet. 23 min: Little is finding pockets of space in the Arsenal midfield but tracking Miedema is proving a harder task. Her former teammate ghosts in behind her and drags a shot wide from quite a way out. 21 min: Arsenal beat City’s press really effectively as Pelova finds Caldentey but the latter’s cross drifts behind for a goal-kick. 20 min: Greenwood’s corner is deep, Shaw gets on the end of it but her header is wide. 19 min: Miedema finds Fujino on the edge of the box but Catley is there to block the shot. Corner to City … 18 min: City have had more of the ball overall but Arsenal look much more dangerous around the penalty area. 16 min: Smith, a bit shaken but smiling with the physios, is back on after receiving treatment. 15 min: Slegers is asking her wingers to push high and wide. Smith goes to close down Ouahabi by the touchline and gets a whack as the left-back clears the ball. The medical staff are on. 12 min: Smith has another go at driving at the City defence. Foord does the same from the other wing and Casparij takes a risk with a sliding tackle that takes neither ball or player. 10 min: Fox does well to put a stop to a City breakaway by keeping pace with Clinton and winning the ball back. Shaw had dropped deep to try to pull the strings. 8 min: Smith tries to find Russo with a low cross but Yamashita cuts it out. Shaw then has a pop from distance at the other end for City but finds an Arsenal body in the way. Lively start! 7 min: Russo causes problems down the City left and Casparij clatters into Smith on the edge of the area. Slegers is asking for a free-kick and perhaps a little more but the referee isn’t forthcoming. 5 min: Fujino snatches at City’s first chance, making very little contact with a volley as the ball dropped out of the sky. 3 min: Arsenal manage the first shot at goal as Caldentey’s effort from the edge of the box is safely gathered by Yamashita. 2 min: No goal in the first minute this time as Arsenal test City’s ability to play out from the back. When these teams met here on this ground last season, it was quite simply a WSL classic. They served up a seven-goal thriller, and Mariona Caldentey had Arsenal in front inside the first minute, before they went on to win 4-3. Anything similar today and we’re in for a treat. After the players gather together in the centre circle for a moment of unity, the ball is rolling at the Joie Stadium. The rain in the air and on the ground should make for some slick football and maybe (hopefully) a few interesting challenges. Both teams will observe a minute’s silence before kick-off today as a mark of respect to the victims of the attack on a synagogue in Manchester on Thursday. Players are also wearing black armbands with the message ‘A City United’. Manchester City’s men’s team will also hold a minute’s silence at Brentford tomorrow, with Manchester United’s men doing the same at home to Sunderland this afternoon. Vivianne Miedema is another taking on her old employers today. She has found the net in both WSL fixtures against Arsenal since leaving them for Man City at the start of last season. Arsenal will again have a job keeping her quiet today – she’s scored in each of her last three games in all competitions. Her record at Arsenal reads: 172 games 125 goals 4 trophies The conditions are, frankly, atrocious. The rain is relentless and the wind will be a factor too. There are fans in ponchos, some with umbrellas flipping inside out and some fans who underestimated the strength of the storm are now regretting wearing their lightweight summer jacket. Tom Garry will be checking in from the Joie Stadium in a few moments – he was also at Leigh last night to watch Manchester United 1-1 Chelsea. Sonia Bompastor’s WSL champions dropped points for the first time this season after Anna Sandberg’s sumptuous equaliser. Here’s his report: Andrée Jeglertz and Renée Slegers are familiar foes on the touchline. From 2021 to 2023, Jeglertz’s Linköping faced Slegers’s Rosengård seven times in Swedish football. Slegers had the measure of Jeglertz more often than not, winning five times and losing just once in all competitions. Her Rosengård side were Swedish champions in 2021 and 2022: I think especially that year I was coaching in Sweden at Rosengård, what he did with the Linköping team was impressive. If you look at the players they had and the resources they had and the football they played, it was really, really good and I’ve always had a good relationship with Andrée. I think he’s a great guy and a good coach. Chloe Kelly has to make do with a place on the bench for the third game in a row. Her exit from Manchester City – initially on loan in January – came with some parting shots as she accused the club of having “called reporters to assassinate my character and tried to plant negative stories about me”. Renée Slegers has been speaking about Kelly’s return to her former club and the pressure that comes with it: I think Chloe has gone through a lot of things in her football career. She’s now representing us and we’re very proud of that. I think she’ll find the right levels. I think that’s special with Chloe, that she has fire inside her. When she uses it in the right way, which she’s been doing, it creates so much for herself and for the team. We’ve played some high-pressure games with Arsenal last season. She’s shown such a good side of herself with grittiness, resilience, but also composure and I’m really impressed with that. As promised, here are the confirmed starting lineups: Man City (4-3-3): Yamashita; Casparij, Rose, Greenwood, Ouahabi; Clinton, Hasegawa, Blindkilde Brown; Fujino, Shaw, Miedema. Subs: Keating, Layzell, Coombs, Wienroither, Lohmann, Beney, Prior, Thomas, Adedini. Andrée Jeglertz makes just one change as Jade Rose comes in for Gracie Prior after City’s 4-1 win against London City Lionesses last weekend. Arsenal (4-2-3-1): Van Domselaar; Fox, Wubben-Moy, Catley, McCabe; Little, Caldentey; Pelova, Smith, Foord; Russo. Subs: Zinsberger, Reid, Codina, Hinds, Cooney-Cross, Maanum, Mead, Kelly, Blackstenius. Renée Slegers makes three alterations to her XI that drew 1-1 with Aston Villa as Lotte Wubben-Moy replaces Katie Reid at centre-back. Victoria Pelova and Caitlin Foord start on the wing as Frida Maanum and Beth Mead drop to the bench. Hello and welcome to Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off in the WSL, as Manchester City and Arsenal do battle at a wet and windy Joie Stadium. This fixture produced seven goals in February, with the Gunners on the right side of a 4-3 scoreline, so strap in for hopefully more of the same (nicely jinxed, I think). Today’s hosts come into this one off the back of three straight wins after their opening-night defeat to Chelsea, while the European champions remain unbeaten this season but have drawn their past two games. Chloe Kelly is back, it’s Miedema v Mead, and Storm Amy is wreaking havoc – there are talking points aplenty in Manchester. You can get in touch with your comments and questions using this email. The action gets under way at 12pm (BST) and the team news will be along very shortly indeed."
Iman Beney sinks Arsenal in thriller to take Manchester City second in WSL,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/04/manchester-city-arsenal-wsl-match-report,"After finishing outside the European places twice in the past three, trophyless seasons, are Manchester City back? With this pivotal victory and, significantly, this performance, it appears they might well be. They moved up to second in the Women’s Super League thanks to a late strike from Iman Beney that clinched a hard-fought win against Arsenal. It was a game that started poorly, but turned into a five-goal thriller and the result was priceless for the hosts. Arsenal, who dropped points at home to Aston Villa last time out and are now winless in three WSL games, slip five points behind the leaders, Chelsea, after five games, while Manchester City are a point behind the defending champions thanks to Beney’s finish into the bottom corner. It is not the sort of form Arsenal would want to take in to the start of the defence of their Champions League title, when they host OL Lyonnes on Tuesday, but there will now be a bit of pressure building around the club before that difficult-looking game against the eight-time European champions. It was nearly a very different story, though, as it looked as though Chloe Kelly had come back to haunt her former club by scoring an 83rd-minute equaliser. Kelly felt frozen out of the Manchester City team last winter before joining Arsenal; she pointed to the badge on her shirt as she celebrated her leveller in front of the travelling supporters. Manchester City, who have now won four consecutive WSL games since their opening loss at Chelsea, are beginning to click into gear under their new head coach, Andrée Jeglertz. “The game was won by us keeping on believing,” he said. “[At 2-2] there was no player thinking ‘now we just need to protect this result’. That is not happening in this group. This group is still believing that we will create scoring chances and we will win the game.” Their belief was also clear in a first half they dominated, with Vivianne Miedema having a header well saved against her former club. They took the lead when Khadija Shaw headed in Kerstin Casparij’s cross, after great work from Aoba Fujino to release Casparij down the right. The hosts should have doubled their lead when Shaw was played through on goal, but she hesitated too long and when her shot was diverted to Casparij to put the ball in the net, the Netherlands international was offside. Arsenal drew level moments into the second half when Mariona Caldentey lashed in a classy strike. Poor defending at a set piece, though, undid Arsenal for the second game running as they did not deal with Alex Greenwood’s corner and Casparij was able to bundle the ball in to make it 2-1. Arsenal upped their game in response and looked as if they had rescued a point with Kelly’s clinical strike into the corner, but Beney was ruthless on the counterattack after Shaw’s knockdown. The worry for Arsenal will be that last season the champions, Chelsea, dropped six points in the entire campaign whereas Arsenal have already dropped seven. “We are very disappointed with the result,” the Arsenal head coach, Renée Slegers, said. “We know how much strength we have in the squad and when we need to come back from things, we know that we can. We all believe it will come, if we keep working really hard.”"
"Amorim faces crunch clash, Premier League buildup and more – matchday live as it happened",https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/oct/04/amorim-faces-crunch-clash-premier-league-buildup-and-more-matchday-live,"That’s pretty much it for today’s matchday live blog. It’s always a pleasure to be in charge of these so thanks for your comments and emails, which have come in by the bucketload this morning. Leeds v Spurs is our next port of call in Premier League terms but don’t forget we’ve got live Man City v Arsenal WSL action too. After that our live Clockwatch will follow Arsenal v West Ham and Manchester United v Sunderland and we’ll pop up with a teatime blog to cover Chelsea v Liverpool as well, with dedicated reporters at each of those games of course. What more could you want? Thanks again. Bye for now. While we’re on Bournemouth, here’s a stat to shock you: Antoine Semenyo has been directly involved in more goals than any other player in the Premier League (12 – eight goals, four assists); two more than Erling Haaland (10 – nine goals, one assist). Bournemouth’s 26-year-old winger Justin Kluivert completed the unique treble after his stunning long-range strike in Friday’s 3-1 Premier League victory over Fulham. The former Newcastle and Netherlands striker Patrick Kluivert’s sons proved that the Dutch great’s goal scoring instincts run in the family when they found the back of the net on three consecutive days for three different clubs. This week’s streak began in the Uefa Youth League on Wednesday when his youngest, 18-year-old winger Shane, curled a shot home from the edge of the box past to spark Barcelona’s 2-1 comeback win over Paris Saint-Germain. A day later, 24-year-old Ruben, who is a defender, headed home the second goal in Lyons’ 2-0 win over RB Salzburg in the Europa League. “Proud dad,” Patrick, who is now head coach of the Indonesia national team, wrote on Instagram after each of his sons’ teams won their matches. Another good/intelligent comment on why Ruben Amorim is floundering at United, far more smart and succinct than I put it: The Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles with the launch of its first daily football game, On the ball. It is now live in the app for both iOS and Android … so what are you waiting for? We don’t share posts from X Twitter too often these days, but the caption “Anton Stach explains his love for fun” made me laugh. He likes FUN?! Re the Championship early games, William Preston gets in touch: With players and staff not being paid once again, and having lost a lot of people who can score goals at this level before the season even began, I think it’s fair to say that Sheffield Wednesday are currently massively overachieving, despite their league position. The younger players have got an absolute stomp on, and there’s been people thrilling heroics at Birmingham, only conceding at the last. There’s potential here for this to be the best worst season ever, like the one Middlesbrough had in the mid 1990s (my uni housemate had a VHS tape that he put on formula to watch every time we came back from the pub). Have a great stormy day, I hope every stays safe. Here’s a rundown of the lineups in the early kickoffs in England’s second tier: Blackburn v Stoke Blackburn: Toth; Alebiosu, Miller, McLoughlin, Ribeiro; Tronstad, Gardner-Hickman, Morishita; Cantwell, Hedges, Gudjohnsen. Stoke: Johansson; Tchamadeu, Phillips, Wilmot, Cresswell; Rigo, Seko; Thomas, Bae, Manhoef; Mubama. Hull v Sheffield United Hull: Pandur; Coyle, Egan, Hughes, Giles; Lundstram, Slater; Gyabi, Gelhardt, Akintola; McBurnie. Sheffield United: Cooper; Tanganga, McGuinness, Mee; Ogbene, Peck, Matos, McCallum; O’Hare, Hamer, Campbell. Sheffield Wednesday v Coventry Sheffield Wednesday: Horvath; Weaver, Iorga, Lowe; Palmer, Valery, Banna, Ingelsson, Amass; Lowe, Cadamarteri. Coventry: Rushworth; Van Ewijk, Thomas, Kitching, Dasilva; Allen, Grimes, Sakamoto; Mason-Clark, Thomas-Asante, Wright. And you can go in-depth on Leeds v Spurs coverage with Scott Murray, who is on top of the buildup. Should be a cracker, that one. The teamsheets for the 12.30pm BST kick-off at Elland Road have dropped. Here we go. Leeds: Darlow; Bogle, Rodon, Struijk, Gudmunsson; Ampadu, Stach, Longstaff; Aaronson, Okafor, Calvert-Lewin. Subs: Meslier, Justin, Bijol, Bornauw, Gruev, Tanaka, Harrison, Nmecha, Piroe. Tottenham: Vicario; Porro, Romero, Van de Ven, Udogie; Palhinha, Bentancur; Kudus, Simons, Odobert; Tel. Subs: Kinsky, Danso, Spence, Davies, Gray, Bergvall, Sarr, Johnson, Richarlison. Please forgive me for plugging an underrated indie album song of the noughties … let me instead turn your attention to Billy Munday’s WSL minute-by-minute. He’s got you covered for team news and updates from the 12pm BST kick-off at the Joie Stadium. Another email, this time from Richard Warwick in storm-hammered west Scotland, as he puts it: If I can just lighten the mood around Fluxdeluxe’s excellent Amorim comment, can I make a case for the “subtle” renaming of said philosophical thought experiment [from Theseus’s Ship] to “Trigger’s Broom”? Very much more accessible to those of us of a certain age. Yeah I’m most certainly more Only Fools than Greek mythology. Talk about the dumbing down of modern journalism. Sorry. The race for the golden boot. Can anyone stop Erling Haaland? Probably not. Arsenal v West Ham: what can we expect? Nuno Espírito Santo earned the Hammers a creditable 1-1 draw at Everton’s Hill Dickinson Stadium on Monday, his debut as manager after replacing Graham Potter. But this is a far tougher test for his new charges. West Ham have actually won their past two games at the Emirates without conceding, but you’d make Mikel Arteta’s in-form side heavy favourites today. The Gunners have lost just once this season, winning seven of their nine in all competitions. Despite all the ‘handbrake’ chat, they’ve played pretty fluent football. Nuno, meanwhile, has won just three times in 10 outings against Arsenal as a manager, losing four and drawing three, averaging 1.2 points a game, including a 3-1 defeat in his only North London derby (yes, I often forget Nuno was briefly Tottenham manager, too). Tuck into our previews featuring all the team news you could possibly need. Those team graphics make me oddly nostalgic for reading the Saturday sport supplement at my grandparents’ house. Simpler times. Oliver Glasner has warned Crystal Palace must not allow their “top level” to slip at Everton on Sunday or face the “high risk” of seeing a club-record 19-match unbeaten run come to a halt. “In the Premier League, the players know you need to perform close to your top level, otherwise you have a high risk of losing the game,” Glasner said on the Palace website. “I don’t think Everton have struggled. They drew against West Ham, they lost a very tight game against Liverpool and I think they had a very good performance against them. We always have to accept how the other team is playing and try to use their weaknesses to win the game.” Glasner said he was not interested in revelling in Palace’s hot streak. “We don’t talk about it (the run) in our meetings, or on the pitch – but yes, we are asked about it more and more. “The approach is the same. We don’t go to Everton saying: ‘Let’s just extend the run’, we go there and will try to win the game. Every win, every good performance, increases self-confidence and this is what we can see.” Rant over. I’m aware there are other clubs. Although I note many of the comments dropping in are about Amorim and/or United … This is an interesting comment below re Ruben Amorim. My own attempt to explain his personal struggles as Manchester United manager (which is in stark contrast to his success at Sporting) would be to suggest the Portuguese league is far easier and primed for a differential formation like 3-4-3 which, with players better than most of their opponents, was enough for the Lisbon side to overcome Benfica and Porto. That is all you need to do. Amorim now has better players to work with, but I think the strength of the current United squad is overestimated. The likes of Altay Bayindir, Diogo Dalot and Patrick Dorgu – who all start regularly – are mid-table players. There’s clearly long been a culture problem at the club. Many players are still overpaid compared to their talent/output from the Glazer/Woodward era and that takes time to cleanse. On the field, past defeats mean the team has such a brittle mentality that the smallest piece of adversity (like a missed penalty, a perceived injustice) knocks them off their path. Only Bruno Fernandes – and he is criticised more than most – seems to have the mental fortitude to withstand the pressure cooker environment and (try to) drive standards higher. Another email. Steve Horne gets in touch: Hi Dominic. Anything to take my mind off Storm Amy as I shelter in my campervan in Rothes, Morayshire, so here goes: Leeds 1-2 Spurs Man Utd 0- 2 S’land Arsenal 1-1 West Ham Chelsea 1-3 L’pool Yeah it’s not campervan weather, Steve. Interesting Manchester United prediction there … United will hold a minute’s silence on Saturday and the players will wear black armbands as a mark of respect after the terrorist attack at a synagogue in the city on Thursday. Manchester City will do likewise for their Premier League and Women’s Super League fixtures this weekend. Here’s what Amorim has said on his own future and Manchester United’s struggles: “Nobody here is naive,” said Amorim. “We understand that we need results to continue the project. We will reach a point that is impossible for everyone, because this is a very big club with a lot of sponsors, with two owners. “It’s normal. You can’t run away from the results. Then you have the baggage from last season, but last season for me doesn’t matter. “We have had six games this season, and we lost three. So it’s the results. But imagine if we won the first game against Arsenal and then you don’t miss the penalty and you win against Fulham, even without playing really well. Imagine if this happened, then the trust in everything about our club, the system, the way we play, would be completely different. “So if you win, everything is okay. If you lose, you’re doubting everything about yourself, about your team-mates, about the coach – everything. I just need one more game, because football is like that. We need one more game, we win, we get some hope and then in the next game we will see.” Fairly refreshing and candid stuff from the United boss. One more game? He’ll certainly get that… it’s whether he gets many more after it. Let’s do the big Manchester United talk. I’ll break it in gently by pointing you in the direction of this Daniel Harris piece: five simple solutions Ruben Amorim could try to improve United in the short-term (featuring some 3-4-3 formation chat): Fantasy Football Corner: It’s too late to make transfers (as I learned to my cost, forgetting about the early deadline before last night’s Bournemouth v Fulham game), but who’s worth having in your team this week? Logic may dictate that Manchester United’s Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes should fill their boots at home to a promoted team… but logic and Manchester United don’t tend to go hand in hand. Arsenal are trickier to predict now Mikel Arteta has depth available to him, but I’d be plumping for Gunners defenders – Gabriel is always a go-to. To Salah or not to Salah? The Egyptian hasn’t been at his sparkling best this season but he may fancy getting on the scoresheet against old foes Chelsea – struggling themselves at the moment – with Hugo Ekitike another good pick given his strong start to the campaign. Feel free to absolutely deride my team, which is as follows: Henderson; Munoz, Cucurella, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Fernandes, Kudus, Xhaka; Haaland (c), J.Pedro, Beto. I know. Thanks for your comments, now filtering in Below The Line. Let’s have some predictions for today’s four Premier League games, like this one. Mine? Leeds 1-1 Spurs; Man Utd 2-1 Sunderland; Arsenal 3-1 West Ham; Chelsea 1-2 Liverpool. David Moyes admits he would settle for a top 10 finish this season but Everton are hoping for better. Moyes’ men have eight points from their first six matches, currently sitting ninth and just three points off fifth. At the same stage 12 months ago – then under Sean Dyche – the Toffees were 16th with just four points, but having guided the club to a comfortable 13th place by the end of last season Moyes is looking for continued improvement. “You need to think back to where we were last year, how we were going to be as a football club,” he said before tomorrow’s visit of in-form Crystal Palace. “I think we’ve had a positive start; I think we could have taken more points – that’s the message in the dressing room and they know it as well. That’s the challenge, to keep it up. If you gave me this position at the end of the season I’d be absolutely delighted as it would be a huge improvement on where we’ve been but we are striving for more and hoping we can get more.” Phil Parkinson insisted Wrexham are “growing” into the Championship after a third successive 1-1 draw against Birmingham in Friday night’s “Hollywood derby” – even though the Welsh club have not won any of their five home league games since promotion from League One. “This is a squad which is growing together and the signings are getting better all the time,” Parkinson said after Wrexham had extended their unbeaten run to five games. “I’m sure when we wake up tomorrow we’ll be looking at a team which is growing into the division well. We’re very confident of the group and just need to start turning these draws in into wins. We’ve just got to keep growing as a team and we will do.” Former Bath City striker Alex Fletcher called for changes after crashing into concrete hoardings three years ago. As far as he is concerned, nothing happened as a result. Here’s Paul MacInnes reporting on the tragic death of Billy Vigar and an important debate now being had in English football. Paris FC are doing rather well in Ligue 1. The new kids on the block in the top tier of French football beat Lorient 2-0 last night… they may not yet be ready to challenge their high-profile neighbours, but they’re likely to stay up – as three wins from their first seven games since promotion suggests. Elsewhere in Europe last night there were 1-0 away wins for Sassuolo at Hellas Verona and Köln at Hoffenheim. Osasuna snatched a late 2-1 win over Getafe in La Liga. I very much enjoyed this column by Barney Ronay, who poses an interesting question: what do you actually know about Florian Wirtz. The eighth most expensive footballer of all time has got off to an inauspicious start at Liverpool but should we be surprised given his astronomic transfer fee? It’s worth looking at the big fixtures away from the Premier League today. Manchester City v Arsenal at midday (BST) takes centre stage in the WSL; neither side has been at their best since the season started and that looks a tough game to call. Hearts v Hibernian is always big in Scotland but today’s Edinburgh derby (5.45pm) takes on even greater significance given that Hearts are top of the Scottish Premiership. Celtic don’t play until tomorrow. In Spain, Real Madrid host Villarreal at 8pm with early season pacesetters Barcelona facing Sevilla tomorrow. Borussia Dortmund v RB Leipzig and Eintracht Frankfurt v Bayern Munich are important contests in the Bundesliga. Serie A’s main event comes tomorrow evening with the giant clash between Juventus and AC Milan at one of European football’s many Allianz Stadiums. Hearts fans, get in touch: you could see your side go five points clear at the top with victory today! An early email has landed in my inbox via Krishnamoorthy: “Good morning Dominic. Has his excellency Pope Leo spoken to Amorim? Do we expect a decent fight or another shoddy performance? “That makes me wonder – who will go first Ange or Ruben?” I would have thought Postecoglou will get some time to bed in his ideas at Forest, whereas defeat to Sunderland today could spell serious trouble for Amorim. Last night wasn’t just about Antoine Semenyo scoring twice to boost everyone’s FPL teams (except my own). The ‘Hollywood derby’ in the Championship finished 1-1 between Wrexham and Birmingham while in-form Manchester United disrupted Chelsea’s 100% start to the Women’s Super League season as they drew 1-1 at Leigh. Marc Skinner’s side are now just two points off the WSL summit having begun the campaign strongly. Fulham will be wondering what on earth happened to them at the Vitality Stadium last night, mind you. When Ryan Sessegnon fired them into the lead 20 minutes from time, Marco Silva’s side were in pole position, only to be undone by a late Cherries siege, which included Semenyo’s double and a Justin Kluivert scorcher from 25 yards. Jean-Philippe Mateta has described his first call-up to the senior France squad as “a dream come true” after the Crystal Palace striker was selected by Didier Deschamps for the World Cup qualifiers against Azerbaijan and Iceland. The 28-year-old was one of France’s overage players at last year’s Olympics and scored five goals as Thierry Henry’s side won a silver medal. Mateta, who played the first half of Palace’s win over Dynamo Kyiv on Thursday night in Poland, has also represented Les Bleus at various youth levels. He revealed that he had watched the squad announcement with his compatriot Maxence Lacroix’s in his hotel room in Lublin after the Palace defender had a feeling that the former Lyon and Mainz striker’s time had come. “I feel very, very happy; it’s like a dream come true,” said Mateta. “I hope I will stay a long time with this team and help them to win. I saw it on TV. Maxence said: ‘Today they will call you.’ He came to my room and we watched together the list. Didier Deschamps was talking and he said my name. He always told me to work hard and you will get your call. I kept working hard and I got my call.” Asked whether experiencing international football could help his form at Palace, he said: “If I play, I hope I will help the team there to win. Of course, I will come back with confidence. I always have confidence. I think it will bring me more confidence.” Good morning all! The Premier League grind never stops and Bournemouth’s stylish win over Fulham last night got another weekend off to a riproaring start. Antoine Semenyo, eh … what a player. Anyway, we’re building up to Saturday’s action, as usual, on Matchday Live, the countdown/news/interactive football blog where we encourage you to get in touch with your thoughts, comments, predictions and whatever else you have planned for this footballing Saturday. In terms of live action, Leeds v Tottenham is the early top flight offering, plus four games in the Championship, while Arsenal v West Ham and Manchester United v Sunderland are the 3pm games. Can Nuno Espírito Santo kickstart the Hammers at the Emirates? And will there be more trouble for Ruben Amorim against the high-flying Black Cats? The evening game of Chelsea v Liverpool should be just as intriguing, with Arne Slot hoping to avoid a third successive defeat and Enzo Maresca looking to avoid a third successive Premier League defeat. So there’s form. With our writers dropping in bits of colour from across the country and continent, there’s plenty to stay tuned for. Let’s get going …"
Wirtz becomes latest footballer battling to best their objectively weird price tag,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/04/florian-wirtz-latest-footballer-battling-objectively-weird-price-tag-liverpool,"The verdict is in on the new Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson movie, The Smashing Machine, which does look pretty good to be fair. The key takeaway is this. Anyone who might have dismissed The Rock as simply a bald, grizzled, muscled-up fight sport veteran is going to have to eat their words. It turns out The Rock is actually a really good actor. There is talk of a previously unseen ability to inhabit a character, to subsume his entire identity within a role. The role, in this case, of a bald, grizzled, muscled-up fight sport veteran. What’s his secret! Who knew? And what next? A repressed English country house butler who is also, in his spare time, a bald, grizzled, muscled-up fight sport veteran? A Lytton Strachey biopic that recasts the arch Bloomsbury set dandy as simultaneously a bald, grizzled, muscled-up fight sport veteran? Not that there’s anything wrong with this. It’s good casting. It makes sense, like asking the real-life Smashing Machine guy to play someone called The Destruction Appliance, or signing up Daniel Day-Lewis for a portrayal of glowering method actor icon Derek Cheese-Omelette. Horses for courses. Roles that replicate roles. It also leads on to the obvious question. What do you actually know about Florian Wirtz? There are the obvious football things. Wirtz has played eight regular-season games for Liverpool and looked in snatches light, twirly, fun, nimble, high-technique. He is also yet to register a goal or an assist, or perform as he can, although he will hope to break that run at Chelsea on Saturday evening. The view is that Wirtz needs to adapt, speed up and intensify his game, get used to having fewer touches. What else? He has nine siblings. He looks like a 20th-century Balkan anarchist-poet. His dad was the coach of his village club in the kind of place that sounds as if it’s always covered in snow, where everything is basically gingerbread, harpsichord recitals and historical town-square atrocities. Otherwise nobody really knows much about Florian Wirtz. What is “Florian Wirtz”? A way of standing and running. A lighted shape on a screen. A feeling, a hot-button topic, an avatar of anxiety and excitement. Even Florian Wirtz doesn’t know much about Florian Wirtz, who in June had just turned 22, who had only ever played in Germany, and who became, absurdly, the eighth most expensive footballer of all time. In the past week Wirtz has been the object of an endlessly replicating screed of articles, echoes, news-scrapings, 67,000 of them and counting according to Google. From thundering comment on Arne Slot’s MASSIVE INBOX, to gravel-voiced pros on radio segments who look as if they woke this morning beneath a mound of kebab meat and have disparaging views on his basic physical courage, to very angry men in Micronesia producing alarmingly detailed daily missives on his accumulated failings. The Wirtz dialogue is dense and structural, powered along by tribal hatreds, comparative economics, trade balance, market values. At the end of which the actual Florian Wirtz, a youthful attacking midfielder, has played 689 minutes of autumn football in a transitional team. And the only actual issue, for which he carries no responsibility, but which will subsume everything else, is that objectively weird price tag. There is an important point here. In a sport where every metric is minutely ranked, why is football so blind to the power of transfer fees? The basic evidence is clear. Spending statement money is a massive gamble every time, almost a self-fulfilling act of sabotage. Let us study that well-thumbed list. Of the top 35 priciest moves, 18 have been total turkeys. Arguably, at the time of writing only one of the top 10, Jude Bellingham to Real Madrid, has worked as it was meant to. In a moneyballish, number-heavy game why do so many clubs not acknowledge the most obvious data point? If you’re paying over £80m the stats say this is unlikely to work. You could take an age debating the names. I will discount out of hand the top one, Neymar’s €222m move to Paris Saint-Germain, an abomination that distorted an entire market, a move that gave us Neymar dancing on crutches in a Parisian fashion dungeon wearing only a solid-gold bowler hat, and which functions only as a kind of tell. If you think an absence of regulation, allowing a government to splurge its marketing budget on athletic talent is a “free market”, you really have no idea what a free market is. The same goes for No 2, Kylian Mbappé to PSG, who had to let him go to finally win the Champions League. Scroll down and it’s Gareth Bale at No 18 and Harry Kane at 21 before you get to a move that was clearly worth it based on returns and an absence of referred pain. The real duds are potential club wreckers. No 10: Eden Hazard to Madrid, the GDP of a small country in exchange for a nice holiday in a city where the ham is good. Neymar to Al-Hilal, more an act of community damage limitation, like taking a plague ship into dock for the sake of the wider good. Overall only seven of the top 35 transfers look like value for money right now: Virgil van Dijk, Frenkie de Jong and Neymar to Barcelona, Kane, Bale, Gonzalo Higuaín to Juventus. And finally the daddy transfer, Madrid signing Cristiano Ronaldo, who is whatever else an absolute sporting machine, who eats transfer fee pressure as a high-protein mid-morning snack. The specific issue with Wirtz is that he is being asked to do something new. Here is a list of every creative attacker under the age of 23 who has been bought for €100m and asked to step up into a stronger league: João Félix to Atlético Madrid (total bust). Ousmane Dembélé to Barcelona (house-trashing meltdown). Antony at Manchester United (a year standing on the touchline looking as if he wanted to kick over a traffic cone). Enzo Fernández to Chelsea (improving). And Bellingham, who deserves respect just for getting this far. So good luck with all that, Florian. And yes, transfer fees are invisible, nobody’s fault and could ideally just be ignored. On the other hand spending this much is often a symptom of wider dysfunction: a statement, a gamble, a panic, or more commonly buying at the top of the value curve and just hoping it carries on like that. Fees do matter. This is money that can’t be spent in other areas. It creates an internal hierarchy. It sets unrealistic expectations. It seems absurd a few years on that Paul Pogba could be singled out as the key reason Manchester United aren’t good. Price tags are bullshit, arbitrary and subject to the Premier League premium. But price tags are also heavy when you’re 22, an elevation to a list alongside genuine greatness, fixed points in the history of a sport. And of course the hunger for instant returns deprives us of other things. So many great footballers have taken time. But for Wirtz time will be short, scrutiny brutally blunt. The only real issues are a very obvious need for adaptation. At Bayer Leverkusen he had five defensive players behind him and was the funnel for every forward move. Liverpool are reaching for a new shape. The Salah-Trent axis, the heart of the Klopp era, has vanished. Wirtz has also arrived as a creative sprite just as the league prepares for a culture shift into collisions, power, hard running, set pieces. His delivery is good, but otherwise he has no role in these phases. At Arsenal on Wednesday Daniel Podence, who is 5ft 4in, could be seen actively sprinting away from every set piece like a guilty husband caught on kiss cam. At one point he leapt for a high ball and it was as if someone had thrown an action man at Ben White from a passing car. It should work out. Wirtz is a seriously good footballer. But time is just so short. A €60m Wirtz can be dropped, worked on. A €125m Wirtz has to stay the course in the brightest of lights, a little stretched and miscast, the latest to feel the heat of list-heritage, of football’s monied stupidity, carrying his delicate skills out once again into the smashing machine."
"As Billy Vigar’s family grieve, FA faces questions over its response on safety issues",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/04/billy-vigar-fa-ground-safety-wingate-finchley,"When Chichester City confirmed that Saturday’s FA Trophy tie with Farnham Town would go ahead, they did so with a message: “Billy Vigar, forever in our hearts.” The match, the team’s first since Vigar’s tragic death a week previously, would be contested to “honour Billy”, the club said. “We invite you to join us in paying tribute to Billy on the day.” Vigar, 21, died after sustaining a “significant brain injury” during Chichester’s Isthmian Premier League fixture at Wingate &amp; Finchley on 20 September. His passing was mourned by Arsenal, where Vigar had been part of the academy, and more broadly by clubs and individuals from across non-league football. There was a great sadness at the passing of a player who was well liked in a tight-knit community but had died, as Vigar’s family put it, “playing the sport he loved”. Although the cause of the lethal injury is yet to be officially confirmed, it is expected that it will be attributed to a collision between Vigar and a concrete perimeter barrier which surrounds the Wingate &amp; Finchley pitch. In the aftermath of the player’s death, the Football Association announced it would conduct “an immediate review … that will focus on the safety of perimeter walls and boundaries around pitches in the National League System” – from the fifth to the 10th tier. The FA’s announcement was met with astonishment in the lower levels of the football pyramid, partly because such incidents had happened before. “When I first heard news of the incident I just felt shellshocked,” says the former Bath City striker Alex Fletcher. “We will wait to see what the details and the specifics are but, obviously, it was being widely reported that it was a very similar incident in nature to mine. So it brought a lot back to me.” Fletcher crashed into concrete advertising hoardings at Bath City’s Twerton Park during a match in November 2022. He sustained head injuries which necessitated emergency surgery and left the then 23-year-old in a coma. Eventually he returned to playing but had to relearn how to walk and is permanently deaf in his left ear. After his recovery, Fletcher spoke out about his experience and called for changes in the rules governing pitch boundaries to better take into account the safety of non-league players. As far as he is concerned, nothing happened as a result. “Until now the leadership from the FA has been nonexistent,” Fletcher says. “I was very public and very vocal about what needed to be done. We tried to ask the people who are responsible for setting these regulations to involve players more in it because they’re the ones ultimately going to be able to tell you where they don’t feel safe. That consultation process hasn’t happened.” This is especially shocking to Fletcher because his accident led to an intervention by government. In 2023 the then sports minister, Stuart Andrew, sent a letter to the FA jointly written with the Professional Footballers’ Association. The letter called on leagues (the FA oversees the operation of the National League system) to “take a proactive approach in working with clubs to ensure ground risk assessments take place, that clubs engage with players and other parties who may be able to help identify areas of concern within grounds, and that all parties work to put sensible mitigation measures in place where necessary to help improve player safety”. The letter continued: “As part of that process, we would also ask that leagues look at any standardised guidance they may give to their clubs on this issue to see whether it can be refined or improved.” The FA says that responsibility for the health and safety of “participants and spectators” at the National League system level “is the responsibility of the clubs and their local authorities”. It does, however, set the minimum standards any club must follow in order for a stadium to be accredited to stage a match. In 2023, after Fletcher’s injury, the FA opted to conduct a broad review of safety at stadiums within the National League system and has since visited 890 football grounds. The body conducting the review said it had been commissioned in part because “there was very little information held centrally by any of the stakeholders such as the Premier League Stadium Fund, the FA and the Premier League on the facilities used”. Those inspections will feed into future guidance on stadium criteria, according to sources, but currently the criteria relating to perimeter barriers, which are largely in place to stop spectators from entering the pitch or balls running far beyond it, require that they are of “sound construction (eg concrete and steel)”. The absence of any intervention from the FA has distressed many in the National League system who say the warnings of the risks to players’ safety were made clearly and repeatedly. “It was a really strange one because nothing happened and you expected it to,” says John Peel, a director at Lewes, another Isthmian Premier League side. “Sometimes it takes a long time to come up with a new decision or a new policy. So you’re always kind of thinking: ‘Well, maybe it’s coming.’ But it never did.” Describing the FA’s statement in response to Vigar’s death as “really odd”, Peel said: “I thought it passed the buck a little bit when really it’s their responsibility because they’re the ones who set the rules.” Lisa Nandy, the secretary of state for culture, media and sport, said this week that government would be “reviewing with sporting governance bodies the safety conditions of sports venues across the country” with a view to ensuring we never have another tragedy like this again. Fletcher says it is the FA’s responsibility to determine what happens next and what the solutions should be to an issue that has been obvious for some time and has now claimed a human life. He suggests the distance between the boundaries of the pitch and any barrier, the so-called “run off”, should be looked at, alongside a move away from inflexible, hard materials. “We know that clubs aren’t blessed in all divisions with a great deal of space around the stadium,” Fletcher says, “but the [minimum] distance of [the run-offs], you’re talking no longer than the length of an average male. That’s not enough room for a footballer to stop when they’re competing full-blooded on the pitch. The material is what I maintain is the biggest problem. I’ve played at plenty of grounds where you’ve got these more flexible materials that are designed to give way on impact. And what that would mean is a greater stopping distance, obviously, for the player.” The minimum run-off requirement in the National League system is 1.83 metres while the minimum in the EFL is 2.25m, with 2.75m preferred. The minimum for any new-build in the National League system, however, is three metres. That is the recommended minimum run-off in the Premier League. Wingate &amp; Finchley announced last weekend that they intended to install “rubber safety padding” around their ground after the tragedy, saying “there is currently no appetite for football at the Maurice Rebak stadium”. Their home match on Saturday will be hosted by their opponents, VCD Athletic. Lewes, meanwhile, have offered counselling to their players and say they will not force anyone to play in grounds with perimeters which feel unsafe. These are mitigation in the face of a broader problem which has been waiting too long for a solution. Meanwhile the family of Billy Vigar will continue to grieve."
‘Let’s embrace change’: Nuno believes West Ham can turn season around,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/03/west-ham-nuno-espirito-santo-arsenal,"Nuno Espírito Santo has said West Ham’s players are willing to change and have taken responsibility for the team’s poor form of the past 18 months. Nuno, the club’s third manager since the departure of David Moyes at the end of the 2023-24 season, is hoping to shift the mood in the dressing room after replacing Graham Potter last weekend. West Ham have been short of leadership and there is an acceptance in the squad that they played a part in Potter losing his job after eight months. “I find a nice group of people,” Nuno said. “They are starting to realise that we have to change things. If we don’t change, things will be the same. They are willing to change. I can see it. So let’s embrace it and let’s change it. “It goes from technical, tactical, physical, mentality, respect, communication. Communication is such an important tool for us. We still don’t have it fully. It has to be a fair and clear communication that we share. They have accounted themselves responsible and are willing to go.” Nuno has had little time to adjust. He does not have his backroom staff yet and the former Nottingham Forest manager is not thinking about what West Ham, 19th before visiting Arsenal on Saturday, can achieve this season. “My task is simple,” Nuno said. “It’s tomorrow.” A big concern for Nuno is improving his side’s defending at set pieces. West Ham have shipped eight goals from corners this season – the latest concession came in Nuno’s first game, Monday’s 1-1 draw at Everton – and will be under sustained pressure from dead balls against Arsenal. The worry for Nuno is that it becomes a psychological issue. “It can,” he said. “But we will try to avoid it. The worst thing that can happen is that if an opponent gets a corner we start immediately thinking that we are in trouble. It can become a trauma.”"
"Chelsea injuries are ‘consequences’ from Club World Cup run, says Maresca",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/03/chelsea-enzo-maresca-injuries-club-world-cup-liverpool-red-cards,"Enzo Maresca believes Chelsea are paying the price for their Club World Cup exertions, with the manager without “seven or eight” players for Saturday’s visit of Liverpool. Cole Palmer is out with a recurring groin problem, joining the long-term absentees Wesley Fofana, Liam Delap, Levi Colwill, Andrey Santos and Tosin Adarabioyo on the sidelines, and Trevoh Chalobah is suspended after his sending-off in last weekend’s home defeat by Brighton. A report published by the global players’ union Fifpro this week said Chelsea’s players were given 20 days off after winning the Club World Cup in July, and that the beaten finalists, Paris Saint-Germain, rested players for 22 days, a high workload it linked to both clubs’ injury problems. Maresca said he agreed with the tenor of the Fifpro report before expressing faith in the young players he will call up to stand in, with the 19-year-old Josh Acheampong expected to replace Chalobah at centre-back for his fourth Premier League start. “It’s reality,” Maresca said. “If PSG and Chelsea have so many injuries, probably it’s some consequences from the Club World Cup. In this moment we have four or five defenders out, but we’re going to try to adapt and find the right solution. “It is difficult, but at the same time we trust the ones that are here. For sure, when you can change one player after four or five games, it’s better. The more you play together with teammates, the relationship becomes better. Sometimes you don’t even need to speak to do something on the pitch – they understand immediately. When you continue to change it’s more difficult. “But I really trust the young players. Not just the young players that we buy but also the young players from the academy. We gave games last year to Josh so that shows that I trust young players.” Maresca was on less sure ground when claiming to be unconcerned by Chelsea’s disciplinary record, with João Pedro’s sending-off in their Champions League win over Benfica this week their third red card in as many matches after Chalobah’s dismissal and Robert Sánchez’s in the defeat at Manchester United. Since Maresca joined in June 2024, Chelsea’s disciplinary record across all competitions is the worst of the Premier League clubs, with seven red cards in 73 games, one every 10.4 matches. Chelsea also top the table for Premier League yellow cards under his reign, with 114, and the Italian has the second-highest card-per-game rate at one club in the Premier League at 2.7, a figure beaten by Mauricio Pochettino during his time at Stamford Bridge (2.9). “I don’t see any discipline problem,” Maresca said. “You have to analyse case by case. When it’s a red card for bad intention or for bad discipline, it’s different compared to the United red card or the Brighton red card. In that case, it’s just a decision that you have to take in two seconds, three seconds. Do I do foul or not? It’s difficult.”"
Liverpool out of tune but Arne Slot working on finding better rhythm,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/03/liverpool-arne-slot-rhythm-florian-wirtz,"Don’t panic. Stay calm. The advice from Virgil van Dijk and Curtis Jones was Zen-like in its reassurance in midweek as Liverpool digested back-to-back defeats for the second time under Arne Slot. Slot remained relaxed and upbeat on Friday too, sprinkling his press conference with several unprompted reminders that the team he was defending from rare criticism are top of the Premier League. Again. But behind the soothing messages and positive league table there are undeniable issues with Liverpool’s form that, according to Slot himself, run deeper than the opening 10 games of the campaign. The Premier League champions have not been struggling to create chances from open play or to turn dominant possession into convincing victories since August, their head coach insisted. They have been struggling to do both since the middle of last season, once opponents adjusted their tactics to stifle Liverpool, and are yet to find solutions. It was some admission from the coach of a team that cruised to the title with four games to spare in April and has been enhanced by a £420m summer spending spree. And, yes, that investment does increase scrutiny as well as expectation. “We were very happy winning the league,” said Slot. “But we didn’t shut our eyes for the second part of the season to how many times we needed a set piece [to win]. That is not something bad because Arsenal and Chelsea are needing a set piece almost every single game at the moment. We’ve brought in a very different midfielder than we had last season [Florian Wirtz], which we think we needed because there was a big, big difference between the amount of goals we found from open play in the first part of last season and the second part of last season.” Statistics back up Slot. In the first 19 league games of his debut season Liverpool scored 47 goals with 40 (85.1%) coming from open play. Over the final 19 league games Liverpool scored 39 goals, of which 27 (69.2%) were from open play. The drop-off has been corrected this term, over a small sample size admittedly, with 10 of Liverpool’s 12 league goals scored from open play (83.3%). But Slot’s side stayed out in front over the final 19 games of last season thanks in no small part to eight set-piece goals (20.5% of the total), excluding penalties. This season’s set-piece tally, excluding penalties, is one (8.3%). But Liverpool’s performances this season, notably the defeats at Crystal Palace and Galatasaray in the space of four days, cannot be attributed to a decline in set-piece prowess alone. Even their seven-game winning streak before heading to Selhurst Park was often accompanied by the caveat that Liverpool won late and/or despite an inconsistent display. Wirtz is yet to adapt to the intensity of the Premier League and is a £100m talent that Slot is still trying to accommodate to maximum effect. Liverpool’s new full-backs, Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez, were staunchly defended by their head coach before the Galatasaray defeat but are not currently at the levels of the players they replaced, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson. Alexander Isak is not match sharp having spent the summer on strike at Newcastle, and Ibrahima Konaté’s form has deserted him. The list goes on. Only Hugo Ekitiké, Van Dijk, Alisson, who will miss Saturday’s trip to Chelsea with a hamstring injury, Dominik Szoboszlai and Ryan Gravenberch have performed consistently well this term. Liverpool desperately need Alexis Mac Allister to regain full fitness and his influence over their rhythm, composure and penetration. The Argentina international was left out of the final two games of last season to start his recovery from a persistent groin injury and return fit for pre-season. At least that was the plan. The midfielder’s rehabilitation took longer than anticipated, pre-season was frequently interrupted as a consequence, and a vital cog in Slot’s machine has not completed 90 minutes for his club since the 1-0 win at Leicester on 20 April. “You say he’s playing catchup,” Slot said. “In Holland we say he walks behind the music.” Liverpool will be a different proposition once Mac Allister is conducting midfield alongside Gravenberch again. Slot has extolled the virtues of flexibility in his new-look squad, with the summer arrivals Wirtz, Ekitiké, Isak and Frimpong able to play in a variety of positions, but a team in transition could do with more consistency in selection to speed the process. Slot insists his changes in personnel have been enforced and there will be no change in his approach. “I don’t think we do things differently but I see teams doing a lot of things differently against us,” he said. “Jürgen [Klopp] gave me a lot of gifts but one of the gifts he gave me was ending up third the year before and fifth the year before that, and him being so well-known that a new manager came in and everyone thought: ‘Oh, let’s start to play against Liverpool.’ Teams played in a completely different way in the first half of the season against us than they did when we were top of the league after half of the season. “It is purely about how teams play against us in style and mentality. In Istanbul, [it looked as if] Galatasaray won the Champions League. If you look at Palace, you look at Galatasaray, how much they throw themselves in front of a ball, these things make it harder for us to score from open play than it was in the first part of last season. This is something I already saw last season. That’s why we had the window we had: sometimes to replace, sometimes to add a certain quality. “It’s up to us to show that we can do better in these kind of games than we did in the second part of last season and the first part of this season. In the meantime, we almost won every single game, right? But the margins are not the same any more as the first part of the season: 3-0 Brentford at home, 6-3 Tottenham and 5-0 West Ham.” Liverpool possess enough world-class talent to correct their unconvincing form, as Jones stated this week, but Slot admits the solution is more complex than waiting for Wirtz and Isak to hit their stride. Stamford Bridge would be a good place to start, however. “It’s a combination of things,” Slot said. “How do we find our wingers? Do we find them often enough and in promising situations like we did against Galatasaray? This is what we have to work on and this is what we have to do better than we’ve done until now. “We unlocked teams in the second half of last season by scoring from seven corner kicks. The team we face tomorrow [Chelsea] have scored more than 50% of their goals from set pieces, although they are on eight points. The No 2 in the league [Arsenal] has scored 60% of their goals from set pieces. So they have the same issues if they face a low block, but the way to unlock a low block is to do better. “We have to find ways of unlocking that, maybe scoring the first chance we get or from a set piece. I think there are enough positives to take from this season. If you talk about open-play goals, we’ve done much better in the first part of this season than the second part of last season. But there are things we definitely have to improve. I’m the first one to acknowledge that.”"
Ruben Amorim will not walk from United but admits sack beckons if results do not improve,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/03/ruben-amorim-will-not-walk-manchester-united-admits-sack-beckons-if-results-do-not-improve,"Ruben Amorim insists he will not walk away from Manchester United despite the team’s struggles but accepts he will be sacked if results do not improve. The head coach has picked up 34 points in his 33 Premier League games and the club are 14th in the table having finished 15th last season. United have won two of their opening seven matches in the current campaign, which includes a Carabao Cup exit at Grimsby, and their defeat by Brentford last Saturday extended Amorim’s search for his first back-to-back league victories since arriving 11 months ago. Sunderland visit Old Trafford on Saturday and another defeat would put Amorim under greater scrutiny. Amorim, asked whether he would consider resigning, said: “No, that is a decision of the board. I cannot do that. Sometimes I have that feeling and losing is hard, not to create the momentum. It’s so frustrating when you create the momentum, go to the next game, something happens. That feeling sometimes hurts me a lot. Also the players and especially the staff here. But that is not my decision and I think it would be really hard to leave if I don’t do everything to follow my career here. “It’s a dream to be here and I want to continue here and I want to fight for this. But the problem is now what makes me suffer is to lose games, not to lose my job. You fear to lose your job when you have to pay the bills and I don’t have that feeling.” The 40-year-old also launched an impassioned defence of his 3-4-3 system, which has been the focus of much criticism. Amorim has used the formation in every game and it is yet to provide the consistency craved. “Nobody here is naive,” Amorim said. “We understand that we need results to continue the project. We will reach a point that is impossible for everyone because this is a very big club with a lot of sponsors, with two owners. So it’s hard, the balance is really hard. What I want is to see my team – winning or losing – playing the same way and we are not doing that.” Amorim pointed out that United had played in different systems under previous managers, also without success. “We need to play the same way, with the same power, with the same intensity, with the same focus. If we do that, it doesn’t matter what the system is.” He confirmed plans to play lucrative mid-season friendlies to help boost funds lost by not qualifying for Europe. “We have to do it and we knew it when we miss Europe,” he said. “We have our fans and our budget and we want to be with our fans around the world.” United will hold a minute’s silence on Saturday and the players will wear black armbands as a mark of respect after the terrorist attack at a synagogue in the city on Thursday. Manchester City will do likewise for their Premier League and Women’s Super League fixtures this weekend."
Semenyo’s double downs Fulham and sends buoyant Bournemouth second,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/03/bournemouth-fulham-premier-league-match-report,"At Bournemouth, where Fulham had lost on their last three visits, Marco Silva’s team were tweaking the noses of Andoni Iraola. They had suffered in the wind and rain only to take the lead through Ryan Sessegnon’s well-crafted goal. Silva’s substitutions had turned the game in Fulham’s favour, Samuel Chukwueze combining with Sessegnon almost as soon as he arrived into a pitched battle of a contest. Step forward Antoine Semenyo, one of the Premier League’s players of the season so far. His slaloming run down the byline and drop of the shoulder confounded Bernd Leno to score from the narrowest of angles. Next, the Ghanaian sent Justin Kluivert away to smash in a gorgeous long-range strike. Semenyo’s injury-time second, from a trademark warp-speed counter, supplied by another sub in Ben Gannon-Doak, completed a sweet home win. Bournemouth climbed to second in the table, only Liverpool above them. Just when Fulham were set for fourth time lucky they were denied by Iraola’s expert in-game management, greater depth of resources and a match-winner in Semenyo. “He is incredible,” said Kluivert, no slouch himself, of Semenyo. “He shows it every game now. He is just world class.” Iraola said: “He has been improving every season, every season he has got better. I make him not look too much at the numbers. If we are playing well collectively, the numbers will arrive.” For a sodden Silva, clad all evening in a light sweater that would have needed to be wrung out because of the inclement conditions, his kingdom for a striker. An injury crisis among his centre-forwards meant Josh King, Fulham’s shining star this season, was pushed into an unfamiliar, withdrawn striker/false 9 role unsuited to the teenager’s skill set at this early stage. “This moment of the season is very difficult for us,” Silva said. Despite the elite’s asset-stripping of last season’s team, Iraola’s squad is now more robust. His changes when chasing the game provided testament. “We have lost some important players but we have connected well since the start of the season,” Semenyo said. “It has been a great start and a great environment to be part of.” Second-half substitutes Ryan Christie, Kluivert and Alejandro Jiménez each arrived to play a part in Bournemouth’s decisive, deadly acceleration away from Fulham. The Basque manager’s brand of high-pressing football will cause wear and tear, and where last winter Bournemouth could barely field a team, he currently has the luxury of rotation and tactical switches. The results so far are almost as glowing as his reputation. “When you are losing, you have to try to change the game,” said Iraola. At Bournemouth last season a clerical error meant Fulham subbed the wrong player – Sessegnon rather than Sasa Lukic. Silva did not contain his rage when the latter suffered an early muscle injury. His team’s inability to hold the ball in the first half further darkened his mood. “We had moments to punish them and missed the last pass,” said Silva. Bournemouth were equally blunted, as can happen with a team whose best football comes when Iraola’s players build to crescendos. There can be flat spots. Amid night air filled with drizzle courtesy of Storm Amy, there was frustration. Evanilson, Bournemouth’s striker, struggled for supply. A half of three shots on target, Alex Iwobi scuffing the last, ground to a soggy, merciful halt. “Not a lot was happening,” shrugged Iraola. That 45 minutes represented the lowest combined xG of any first half thus far this Premier League season. Things could only get better? Certainly. When Evanilson’s flying volley hit the side-netting, he inadvertently triggered the Vitality video screens into errant goal celebrations. Real excitement would come soon enough. Jiménez and Kluivert arrived on 60 minutes, Iraola asking the Milan loanee to overlap from right-back, Kluivert to get closer to Evanilson than Marcus Tavernier, who had departed. Silva’s fresh arrivals were the summer additions Kevin and Chukwueze. Did we need to talk about Kevin? It was Chukwueze’s smart exchange with Sessegnon that broke the deadlock. “The 1-0 was a great collective goal from us and then after two individual moments they decide the game,” said Silva. Iraola’s response was to gamble again, take off defensive-minded players in Marcos Senesi and Tyler Adams, and replace them with Gannon-Doak and Christie. “You have to take a risk, there is no other option,” he said. That fresh injection of the talent his squad continue to boast set the stage for Semenyo to further Bournemouth’s rise."
Manchester United 1-1 Chelsea: Women’s Super League – as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/oct/03/manchester-united-v-chelsea-womens-super-league-live,"Tom Garry was at Leigh Sports Village tonight, and here’s his verdict. Thanks for reading this MBM. Chelsea boss Sonia Bompastor speaks to the BBC. “I wouldn’t say I’m satisfied because we always play the games to try to win them … but it’s a tough place to come and play … we were better out of possession in the second half … we created some really good opportunities and scored a great goal … we couldn’t score more than one … but to be fair the draw is the result that reflects most of the game … we tried to be in control … especially in the last 30 minutes … the players who came in did well … energy and quality … some good opportunities … we could have scored but Man United are a good team … good individuals so maybe a fair result tonight.” … then on her yellow card: “I am smiling because for me the call was a wrong call … it was clear to everyone except the referee … so I showed my frustration … of course I know you can’t do that when you are the manager because you have to lead by example but we also lead by emotions … I still think it was the wrong call.” Manchester United boss Marc Skinner talks to the BBC. “I thought it was two teams that wanted to win the game … high level with and without the ball … a fair point in the end … but not for the lack of both teams trying to win it … a good game for the neutral … probably a fair result … the most brave performance … and we’re building … you can sense it … we’re disappointed … the chances we created, not many do that against Chelsea … credit to them … and all the fans that came out to see us tonight … we defended really well … we’ll take the point … move forward … we want more … we’re going to make sure we do that in every other game as well … as best we can.” On Jess Park saying she is frustrated with a point against the champions: “I agree … I want us to act like that … we want more … that’s what we breed into our players … if they’re saying that, which is nice to hear, it means we’re heading in the right direction … hungry for success.” … and finally time to throw the gauntlet down. “We’ll give absolutely everything … it shows to Chelsea that they’re not just going to walk the league … we need to make sure that everybody puts a challenge in … the league is getting better and you saw the quality tonight that we’re progressing to.” A cheerful Jess Park, player of the match, speaks to the BBC. “We played really well … as did Chelsea … it was a brilliant game … we needed to be a bit cleaner and more clinical with the ball … there were moments we defended brilliantly … Maya [Le Tissier]’s last-ditch tackle was phenomenal … we’ll take the draw but we want to win these games … we really competed … obviously it’s frustrating because we want to take the win … you never want to settle for a draw, but, y’know … we’re creating some really good moments … we need to put them to bed but it’s coming together.” That was an entertaining game. Both sides scored fine early goals, and it’s something of a surprise that another didn’t come. Because both teams were front-foot from the get-go. Manchester United recovered after a slow start to string together several smooth moves, Jess Park earning the player of the match award on the BBC. Chelsea weren’t quite as consistent over the 90 minutes, but carved out some big chances during the periods in which they’d put the pedal to the floor. It should be an exciting race for the title on this evidence. United still haven’t beaten Chelsea in the WSL … but they have ensured that the champions’ 100-percent start to the season is over. 90 min +3: Thompson burns her way past Sandberg on the right. She crosses deep for Beever-Jones, who is inches away from the contact that would surely lead to a goal. But it’s not going to happen. Goal kick. That will probably be that. 90 min +2: A huge chance for Chelsea! Nusken with the ball at her feet in the box, and in space, just to the left of centre. She shoots, but Le Tissier arrives out of nowhere to block! Nothing comes from the resulting corner. That probably should have been the winner. 90 min +1: Reiten crosses low from the left. Beever-Jones sticks out a leg in the hope of ramming home, but the presence of Le Tissier forces her to slice wide left. 90 min: There will be four added minutes. Can either side find a heartwarming/breaking winner? 89 min: Bjorn tugs back Toone, and it’s a free kick for United in Chelsea territory. Earlier in the move, Walsh had tugged back Park in the cynical style. She’s lucky not to go into the book. Then the set piece is taken … and what a waste. 87 min: Beever-Jones spins and hits a low shot-cum-cross that Tullis-Joyce doesn’t really deal with. The ball breaks to Walsh on the edge of the box. Walsh attempts to thread a shot into the bottom left, past the unsettled keeper, but Tullis-Joyce makes up for her earlier error with a superb full-length stop. 85 min: Thompson nearly latches onto a weak backpass by Janssen. Tullis-Joyce comes out quickly to smother, and ensure no shot is taken. Janssen owes her keeper one there. 84 min: Incidentally, Kerr was given the what-for by the home crowd when she came on. Perhaps as a result of this … 83 min: Chelsea replace Rytting Kaneryd with Reiten. Meanwhile Malard warms Tullis-Joyce’s hand with a snapshot from the inside-left position. This is in the balance for sure. 82 min: Williams – who scored the winner against United in the FA Cup semi-final two seasons ago – comes on for Rolfo. That was United’s first-ever win over Chelsea; can she score their first-ever winner against them in the WSL as well? Her a former Chelsea player, too. 80 min: Nusken’s first act is to ping a shot wide right from 25 yards. 79 min: The weather seems to have passed through. 78 min: Chelsea make a double change, sending on Kerr and Nusken for Macario and Cuthbert. 77 min: Carpenter goes barrelling down the inside-right channel. She doesn’t really have any options, so keeps going and prepares to shoot, only to run slap-bang into Sandberg. 76 min: Park’s low cross from the right is turned out for a corner by Bjorn. Before it can be taken, Riviere is replaced by Bizet. And then the corner is turbo-blootered clear by Macario. 75 min: A suggestion that, earlier in the move, Thompson had handled a Park flick on the edge of the Chelsea box. No penalty, and there’s no VAR. It may well have been outside the area anyway. 74 min: … but Sandberg releases the pressure with a wild shot from 25 yards. To be fair, she’s got credit in the bank after her spectacular goal. 73 min: United are enjoying the lion’s share of possession. Chelsea can’t get out. 71 min: This is properly in the balance, and the tension at the Progress with Unity Stadium is palpable. 69 min: Fine shots at either end, by the subs. Thompson cuts in from the left and whistles one straight at Tullis-Joyce. Then Rolfo bustles hard down the middle before sending Malard into space down the inside-right; Malard fizzes a daisycutter inches wide of the left-hand post. 67 min: A throw comes in from the Chelsea right. Macario, on the right-hand corner of the box, spins and tees up Beever-Jones, whose first-time shot is deflected by Janssen. The ball loops hysterically over Tullis-Joyce, and so nearly drops back down, having travelled on an absurd parabola, into the bottom right. Just a corner, from which nothing comes. That would have been one to set to a jaunty trombone riff. 65 min: Cuthbert dribbles elegantly down the middle before laying off to Macario on her left. Macario slips further wide for Baltimore, whose low, driven cross is hooked clear under pressure by Zigiotti Olme from Beever-Jones. That’s some fine defensive work by the busy United midfielder. 64 min: A missive from our Tom Garry, in situ in Leigh: I’m amazed there haven’t been more defensive errors from players slipping on the surface here. The rain is torrential now, once again swirling sideways across the pitch. There is hardy group of fans behind the goal to my left who appear to have accepted they are going to be soaked and they are embracing the wet conditions, dancing in the storm and exchanging chants with the travelling Chelsea fans. 63 min: Toone bursts into the Chelsea box from the right. She’s got space and options, but her attempted cutback is no good whatsoever. A few irritated howls of anguish from the stands. 61 min: Macario gets the better of Sandberg down the left and sends a rising diagonal shot that’s clumsily parried away by Tullis-Joyce. It should be a corner, but United are the beneficiaries of a generous free kick, Macario judged to have wrestled Sandberg to the ground. Chelsea boss Sonia Bompastor is booked for telling it as she sees it. 59 min: … so having said that, Park dances in from the left and screeches a shot from the edge of the D inches over the bar. Hampton was under it, but might not necessarily have got a fingertip to it. Malard comes on for Terland. 58 min: Beever-Jones wins a corner down the right. The set piece nearly drops at the feet of Rytting Kaneryd, a couple of yards out, but the defence hacks clear again. All of a sudden, a second Chelsea goal feels the most likely development. 57 min: Chelsea have moved up a gear since the introduction of Thompson. Baltimore tears down the left and wins another corner. United deal with this one as well, but only just about, Miyazawa slicing into the stand. The champions doing champion things right now. 56 min: Walsh carves a long-range shot across Tullis-Joyce and wide of the bottom-right corner. The keeper had it covered all the way. 54 min: Thompson is immediately into the thick of the action, barrelling down the left and winning a corner off Riviere. Nothing comes of the set piece, but that’s better from Chelsea. 53 min: Cuthbert tries to wriggle upfield, and is hauled back in the Red Roses style by Zigiotti Olme. 52 min: Sonia Bompastor has already seen enough, and hooks Kaptein, sending on Thompson. 51 min: Walsh struggles to clear upfield. No room for a good old-fashioned pressure-releasing blooter, with Zigiotti Olme buzzing around her. It looks like the United midfielder has nicked the ball, but the whistle’s gone for an incredibly soft foul. That’s a generous one for Chelsea, who haven’t turned up for this second half yet. 50 min: A corner on the left leads to another on the right. From the second, Sandberg hooks infield from the right, and finds Rolfo, eight yards out. A header floats wide left. This is really good from Manchester United, though. 49 min: … and now Rolfo has a go from distance, aiming a curler towards the same corner. This one pings off Carpenter’s heel and loops over Hampton, bouncing out of play for a corner off the top of the crossbar. 48 min: Toone aims one towards the top-right corner from distance. It’s just over the bar. Not sure Hampton was getting to that, had it been on target. 47 min: It is really raining, to be fair. To use strict meteorological terminology: it’s Beyond Mancunian. United get the ball rolling for the second half. Meanwhile here’s a WORLD EXCLUSIVE: It’s raining in Manchester. Storm Amy giving it the big one. Half-time advertising break. Get on it (pts I and II) A fair scoreline on balance. Both sides on course to stay unbeaten this season. United on track to doing that rare thing: stopping Chelsea from winning after their having taken the lead. 45 min: There will be one additional minute to a first half that’s whizzed by. 44 min: Rytting Kaneryd drives at Sandberg down the right. She twists, turns and finally shoots. Straight at Tullis-Joyce. United have been more intricate in attack, Chelsea more direct. Both have come close in their own way to adding to their goal tally. 42 min: Rytting Kaneryd makes good down the right and crosses long. Baltimore prepares to head home, but Riviere heads clear just in time. 40 min: Cuthbert plays a long pass down the right in the hope of releasing Macario on goal. The flag goes up for offside, and Tullis-Joyce claims on the edge of her box anyway. 39 min: Sandberg, Park and Toone paint crisp triangles down the left flank. Eventually enough space opens up for Toone, who leans back and lifts a shot over the bar from the edge of the box. That would have been quite the goal. 38 min: United’s turn for a bit of sterile possession. Both teams perhaps recovering from their blistering start. 36 min: Chelsea pass and probe, United sitting back for now. Pretty much the first moment of downtime since the first whistle. 34 min: Beever-Jones romps down the left before cutting back for Kaptein, who leans back and, unmarked from eight yards, should score. But she flips her shot straight at Tullis-Joyce, who makes a great point-blank stop. Admittedly a save she should never have been allowed to make. Kaptein tries to ram home the rebound, but only succeeds in hoicking miles over the bar. United get away with one, because as fine a save as it was, the miss was egregious. 33 min: The wind is really whipping around the Progress With Unity Stadium. The corner flags are almost horizontal! 31 min: Toone, quarterbacking from deep on the left, tries to find Zigiotti Olme with a floated pass into the box. But she overcooks it, while her team-mate gives up on the run, and that’s easy pickings for Hampton. 30 min: Beever-Jones and Riviere contest a 50-50, and the former comes off worse. The Chelsea striker expects a free kick, holding her leg and rolling about a bit, but she’s not getting one. She’s not particularly happy about the absence of whistle, and she might have a point. Riviere looked a couple of nanoseconds late. But we play on. 28 min: Both teams are backing themselves in attack. Now it’s Park’s turn to drive aggressively at the Chelsea defence. She nearly busts her way through the thin blue line, but the gap closes just in time. There are more goals in this all right. 26 min: Chelsea have responded to that equaliser as though it was a personal affront. Which to champions it probably was. They win a corner United deals with. Then Carpenter storms down the right yet again, but overhits her cross. The visitors want their lead back. 24 min: A simple long ball down the inside-right pass nearly does for United. Macario spins Janssen and she’s all alone in the box! But the whistle goes for a foul on Janssen. A light stroke of the face, and a generous free kick. Macario doesn’t complain too much, to be fair, but United and Janssen have got away with one there. 22 min: That’s a really good response to falling behind from Manchester United, when you take those aforementioned Chelsea/Bompastor stats into consideration. And it can all be traced back to Janssen’s Beckenbauer-circa-1966-esque elegant slalom from her own half to the edge of the Chelsea box. No assist, but she’ll take United scoring from the next phase of attack. Wow. Chelsea fail to clear their lines. On the edge of the D, Le Tissier cushions a header down for Sandberg, coming in from the left. Sandberg meets the ball flush, sending a dipping screamer across Hampton and into the bottom right. What a pearler! 19 min: Janssen strides out from the back, down the inside left, drifting infield, all the way to the edge of the Chelsea box. She rolls across for Park, whose shot is blocked. That’s such a shame, because that would have been one of the all-time assists. But never mind from United’s point of view, because … 17 min: This is Sonia Bompastor’s 100th league game as a head coach. Of the 99 she’s previously contested, either with Chelsea or previously at Lyon, 90 have been won, and just two lost. Another measure of the size of job United have on their hands now. 15 min: Riviere looks for Toone down the right, and the pass is perfectly weighted … but also perfectly anticipated by Cuthbert, who comes across to get in front of Toone and use her strength to hold off the United player, ushering the ball out for a goal kick. 13 min: Suddenly United are under siege. They can’t get out of their final third. Baltimore swings in another dangerous cross from the left; Janssen is forced to turn behind for a corner. Baltimore crosses the pitch to take the set piece, but it’s cleared confidently by Tullis-Joyce. 11 min: That’s only the second goal United have conceded so far this season. It was a brilliant one, and it could be a costly one. Because here’s Chelsea’s record when opening the scoring in their last 26 WSL games: W24 D2 L0. … and here’s the opener. Carpenter crosses low from the right again. Macario, on the corner of the six-yard box, backheels for Kaptein, who calmly slots across Tullis-Joyce and into the bottom left. That’s a gloriously smooth move! 8 min: Zigiotti Olme has the opportunity to release Riviere into acres down the right, but overhits the pass. Goal kick. Both teams look absurdly open. 6 min: Carpenter is sent scampering down the right by Walsh, who whips a cross to the near stick. Beever-Jones leans back and hoicks over from close range. It was surely easier to score. Somewhere in the multiverse, it’s already 2-2. 5 min: That’s a promising start for United, though: two one-on-one opportunities already, albeit neither a particularly easy one. But all good considering United have never beaten Chelsea in the WSL. 4 min: Chelsea respond through Baltimore, who sashays down the left before curling a delicious ball in for Macario. For a second, it looks as though the goal is at her mercy, but she can’t get a shot away because Le Tissier stubbornly stays in the road to block. Then United counter the counter, Toone driving down the middle and slipping Park into the box down the right. Park tries to float a chip over Hampton from a tight angle, but it clears the bar. Looks like there may be goals in this! 2 min: United are on the front foot immediately. Terland strides purposefully down the inside-left channel. She’s got Rolfo in the middle, but is within her rights to take a pop herself. Her low drive, intended for the bottom left, is kicked away by Hampton. The players also intermingle in the centre circle, linking arms to mark the start of Black History Month … then Chelsea get the ball rolling. The teams are out! United in red, Chelsea in blue. We’ll be off soon, but before kick-off there’s a moment of solemn silence in tribute to the victims of the terror attack on a Manchester synagogue. Perfectly observed. Chelsea’s Sonia Bompastor talks to the Beeb. “Coming into every game we are trying to bring players who can bring specific things to the team and performance … tonight is a tough game … we expect the finishers to come in … I have good quality on the bench.” Manchester United boss Marc Skinner speaks to the BBC. “Fantastic to welcome Hannah [Blundell] back [after giving birth] … it’s been a long time but it’s a very welcome addition to the team … [as for dropping Melvine Malard in favour of Anna Sandberg] because of their bench you have to have two strategies, a start and an end game … in this one we’re looking in a certain way to exact that plan … it was harsh for [Malard] because she’s in excellent form … in reality it’s a bit of a gameplan that hopefully we can spring on Chelsea.” Manchester United make one change to the starting XI from the one that began last Sunday’s 2-0 win at Liverpool … and it’s one with the visit of the all-conquering champions very much in mind. Anna Sandberg comes in for leading scorer Melvine Malard, who drops to the bench. Chelsea rotate three players in/out of the XI that started the 4-0 win at West Ham United last weekend. Ellie Carpenter and Sandy Baltimore return as right-back and left-back respectively, with Catarina Macario coming into the midfield. Veerle Buurman, Oriane Jean-François and Alyssa Thompson drop to the bench. Manchester United: Tullis-Joyce, Riviere, Le Tissier, Janssen, Rolfo, Sandberg, Miyazawa, Park, Toone, Zigiotti Olme, Terland. Subs: Middleton-Patel, Rendell, Blundell, George, Awujo, Ildhusoy, Naalsund, Malard, Williams. Chelsea: Hampton, Bjorn, Bright, Carpenter, Kaptein, Cuthbert, Walsh, Baltimore, Kaneryd, Macario, Beever-Jones. Subs: Peng, Reiten, Thompson, Buurman, Kerr, Hamano, Jean-Francois, Nusken, Potter. Just four games in, and already this feels like it could be a potentially decisive fixture. Look! Manchester United can go top if they win tonight. It’s a big ask, even with home advantage, not least because Chelsea haven’t lost in the WSL since the tail end of the 2023-24 season – and they still went on to win the title – but also because Erin Cuthbert and Aggie Beever-Jones are currently in the sort of form that’s seen them pinging the ball into this top corner and that one. Yep, it’s a big ask. Yet having said all that, United will still have confidence in their ability to end the 500-day-plus unbeaten WSL run of the best team in the land. Partly because their defence is formidable – they’ve only conceded one goal in their first four gamedays – and they’ve got spectacular goals in them too: step forward Hinata Miyazawa, and, without breaking stride, launch a howitzer. With Melvine Malard joint top of the early goalscoring charts alongside the aforementioned Beever-Jones, there’s enough in-form attacking talent on show for this to be a thriller, and if I’ve tempted the Football Gods into serving up a 0-0, I can only apologise in advance. Kick-off in Leigh, Greater Manchester is at 7.30pm BST. It’s on!"
Sandberg’s superb strike denies Chelsea as Manchester United hold WSL leaders,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/03/manchester-united-chelsea-womens-super-league-match-report,"There was plenty of entertainment for neutrals and ample chances for both teams to win it but, ultimately, Chelsea and Manchester United had to settle for a draw that maintained their unbeaten starts to the Women’s Super League season, on a night when the United manager Marc Skinner believed his team made a big statement of their intent. The 1-1 draw extended United’s agonisingly long wait for a first WSL victory against Chelsea but ended the defending champions’ 100% start and United will have taken great encouragement from a performance that showed they may well have the qualities to mount a serious title challenge. “I like that we weren’t happy at the end because we wanted to win the game,” Skinner said. “I thought we were excellent, barring the first 10 or 15 minutes where I felt we paid them a little bit too much respect, but with the ball tonight it was a really good example of how we’ve evolved; we were really confident with the ball. For the neutral it was a good draw and a high level of quality from both teams.” The quality level certainly was high and for a game played between the teams with the two best defensive records in the WSL last term, and which had conceded the fewest goals this season before kick-off, the game began in a surprisingly open fashion as both attacked early on. The contest opened at such a fast pace that it could easily have been 2-2 inside the first six minutes, with Hannah Hampton saving with her feet from Elisabeth Terland, Catarina Macario’s effort being blocked by Maya Le Tissier, Jess Park firing narrowly over the crossbar and then Aggie Beever‑Jones following suit when she seemed certain to score. Chelsea did then provide the goal that the early flurry of attacks had threatened, as Wieke Kaptein met Macario’s clever back-heeled pass and slotted in a neat, clinical finish low into the corner, as the hosts conceded a league goal for only the second time this season. Manchester United had lost 10 of their previous 11 WSL meetings with Chelsea, but this confident version of Skinner’s team were unwilling to roll over. Inspired by the dribbling of Park, who seemed determined to skip her way past as many defenders as possible and was the driving force of her team’s adventurous play, they continued to create chances and they were soon level when Anna Sandberg scored her first goal for the club. She could hardly have caught her strike any sweeter, angling her foot perfectly over the ball to arrow a half-volley powerfully past Hampton from just outside the area. It was Park that drew Skinner’s highest praise after the game as he said: “She’s electric. She twists, she turns. She was incredible. I think her and Tooney [Ella Toone] have brought each other to life.” The game was played amid Storm Amy, which brought swirling rain and gusts of wind, and started with a minute’s silence after the terrorist attack on a synagogue in Manchester on Thursday, with the home side also wearing black armbands as a mark of respect. This was the ground where Chelsea clinched last season’s title, but this looks like a much improved United team and they continued to threaten in the second half, with Fridolina Rolfö’s deflected effort looping on to the top of the bar before Park’s swerving effort flew narrowly over. Melvine Malard, on as a substitute, dragged a low shot wide with 21 minutes remaining. Skinner had said on Wednesday that he wanted his team to be brave and “show Chelsea that you can beat them”, and they certainly seemed to respond to his rallying cry as they continued to play with intensity and attacking intent, while Chelsea remained dangerous at the other end too, with Beever-Jones going close. Chelsea’s Sjoeke Nüsken bent an effort just wide of a post as the visitors began to search for a late winner, and Alyssa Thompson was almost able to race through on to a loose ball inside the penalty area but she was tackled by the quick thinking United goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce, who also dived low to her left to keep out a Keira Walsh shot moments later. Guro Reiten had a shot blocked in stoppage time, as late Chelsea pressure grew, but in the end a draw was a relatively fair result, which Sonia Bompastor seemed to agree on as she said: “As much as we have the desire to win every game, I think it’s not a bad result, coming here, one of the toughest places to play, getting a draw is not a bad result, even if three points would have been a lot better. I’m not happy tonight, even if I’m smiling, just because we didn’t win the game. I don’t care about our unbeaten run.”"
Tuchel says best players do not always make best team after Bellingham omission,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/03/tuchel-says-best-players-do-not-always-make-best-team-after-bellingham-omission,"Thomas Tuchel has said the best players do not always make the best team and suggested Jude Bellingham might have been excluded from the latest England squad even if the midfielder were in peak condition after his return from a shoulder injury. England’s head coach, who said there also might not have been a recall for Bukayo Saka if his fellow Arsenal winger Noni Madueke were fit, has placed a heavy focus on team spirit with his selection for next Thursday’s friendly at home to Wales and the World Cup qualifier in Latvia the following Tuesday. Tuchel loved the energy in the camp when his side beat Andorra and excelled against Serbia without Bellingham last month and has seen no reason to alter the group dynamic. Yet that loyalty caused an inevitable stir when he decided not to restore some of his biggest creative talents on Friday. There was no place for Bellingham, who has started only once for Real Madrid this season, and no return for Phil Foden despite the attacker’s resurgence at Manchester City. Tuchel was partially able to put Bellingham’s absence down to fitness. However, it was clear to the German that the Madrid midfielder wanted to be called up when the pair spoke on the phone. Tuchel apologised to Bellingham in August for saying that the player’s “edge” can come across in a way that “can be a bit repulsive”. This time Tuchel was keen to stress there is no problem between him and the 22-year-old but he came ready to defend the omission of England’s player of the year for 2024-25. “We’re building the best team,” said Tuchel, who was even more forthright when it was put to him that sides who win the World Cup tend to pick their most dangerous forwards. “Do you have proof of that?” he said. “It doesn’t count what we did in the last camp? I have proof that last camp was our best camp. I stick with the squad.” Tuchel believes the win over Serbia provided enough evidence not to pick Bellingham and Foden. Everton’s Jack Grealish was also left out. “Don’t you think that behaviour on the bench, support from the bench, support from training, the competition, the togetherness enables the 11 to play like they played?” he said. “I strongly believe that. I felt it in Belgrade, behind me on the bench. It’s not against Phil, it’s not against Jack, it’s not against Jude. Even if you can turn it around and say it is, it is not. It is for the guys who were in camp and who performed at this kind of level.” Tuchel indicated that the situation might have been the same if Bellingham was fully fit. “It would have been a different basis, but it could have been the same outcome,” he said. Emphasising he has no personal issue with Bellingham, he said: “To make it fully clear, we can have the same harmony, the same level of performance with him.” England have plenty of options at No 10 – Morgan Rogers excelled against Serbia, Eberechi Eze and Morgan Gibbs-White have retained their spots – and Tuchel pointed out he had to reward those who have proved themselves to him. “What would be my explanation to leave them out and also be authentic in my words?” he said. “After the Serbia match I went into the dressing room and I told them what I told you. Imagine then I have a phone call and leave four players out. What would you think as a player? For credibility as a coach you need to walk the talk.” The only change was enforced, the injured Madueke dropping out for Saka, who has recovered from a hamstring strain. Tuchel, who insisted this squad should not automatically be read as a sign of his intentions for next summer’s World Cup, is keeping his players on their toes. He said there was a chance Saka would have missed out if Madueke were fit. There was focus on another absent attacker, Chelsea’s Cole Palmer, who has a groin strain. Palmer has been unavailable for five of the past seven England camps, raising the prospect of him falling out of Tuchel’s plans given that there are only two camps before the World Cup after this month. Tuchel said he did not expect Palmer to play for Chelsea against Nottingham Forest on 18 October. Tuchel did not name a direct replacement at full-back for the injured Tino Livramento. John Stones is back at centre-back after pulling out last month. Tuchel spoke to Foden, Grealish, Adam Wharton, Trevoh Chalobah and Curtis Jones about leaving them out but did not call Burnley’s Kyle Walker about his second consecutive omission. Tuchel said he was in favour of England’s games at the World Cup kicking off as late as possible because of concerns over heat in Canada, Mexico and the US, even though fixtures starting in the small hours or middle of the night in the UK would cause complications for domestic supporters and broadcasters. “I know the fans will not like it but for us it’s better if we play later,” Tuchel said. “For everyone it’s better to play later. If you do a run at 2pm in Charlotte then you know. We have put the players first. The players are the game and we have to protect the game. “Midnight here, I understand that it’s bad for our fans, it’s bad for the children, bad for the young people who go to school, very bad. There will be a lot of drop-outs the next day at school.”"
England fans ‘astonished’ by World Cup ticket prices; Antony hits out at United treatment: as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/oct/03/weekend-football-countdown-nottingham-forest-postecoglou-england-squad-premier-league-news-live,"As the rain lashes against my window and I finally accept that the football season has begun, following the conclusion of the County Championship, it’s time to close this down. Thanks for reading and here are a few tasty morsels from earlier. Speaking of 10 thing to look out for this weekend, I did an unintentional funny when I wrote of Villa and Emery: “A flat start this season has been the first significant bump in the road.” But rather than frantically changing it to something like “poor start” I chose to let it ride. Thanks to AlexWriter and co. for pointing it out. I also wrote “Form is a funny thing – just ask Morgan Rogers.” DeJongandtherestless’s comment: “I did but he wasn’t impressed with me just turning up at his home like that” is topping the comments charts with a massive 80 upvotes. But hey, back to Amorim. Here’s a comment, BTL on “10 Things …”, from Basilides: “Despite some marginal improvement in the stats (except goals for, goals against and points gained) Manchester United are stuck in a downward drift that is now going on for over a decade. While the root cause is the hollowing out by the Glazers it’s not helped by a continual switcheroo of manager for whatever is the ‘flavour of the month’ at that time. Apart from the lack of investment in facilities in the club’s the complete inability to set up a decent Director Of Football organisation since 2005 is the main reason that the directionless floundering has continued at United for so long. “It’s very hard to see how Amorim survives - his method works well when he has one of the best squad of players in a league - he had this in Portugal - but he doesn’t have this in England and it’s not going to happen any time soon. Even if he does get the best out of this squad it would only be getting to the levels of Brighton, Crystal Palace or Bournemouth (which I would take in an instant right now) but United are supposed to be (and spending on transfers and wages as if) one of the biggest clubs in the world. The problem is if Amorim goes, who steps in that would do better with this completely all over the place squad? Iraola? Glasner? Howe? Potter? Solskjær? Ten Hag? Big Sam?” Warnock? In the Championship, Wrexham v Birmingham kicks things off at 8pm today. See the second-tier fixtures here. Top of the table Middlesbrough head to sunny Portsmouth (3pm tomorrow), Coventry go so Sheffield Wednesday (12.30pm tomorrow), third-placed QPR go to Bristol City (also tomorrow 3pm). Millwall fans, not to mention the manager Alex Neil, will want a response when they host West Brom after the midweek thrashing by Coventry. It’s been an absolute smorgasbord of soccer content on here today. Here are the football-related pieces we’ve published, including the Sports quiz of the week, in case you missed anything earlier: The nice people at Reuters have sent a Barça bulletin: Barcelona’s Lamine Yamal will be sidelined for “two to three weeks” after aggravating a groin injury. The 18-year-old winger, who had been called up for Spain’s World Cup qualifers against Georgia and Bulgaria, will not be part of the national squad after the issue flared up after the Champions League loss to Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday. The injury has caused Yamal to miss four games already this season. He sustained it in September’s international break when Spain faced Turkey and Bulgaria, igniting a row between club and country. The Barcelona manager, Hansi Flick, said the Spain team “should take better care of players”, comments that clearly provoked Spain coach Luis de la Fuente. De la Fuente said on Friday he “was surprised by the German manager’s comments, given he is a manager who has also coached a national team. I thought he would have had more empathy.” The timing is cruel for Yamal, who had just returned from his previous three-week layoff to help Barcelona beat Real Sociedad last weekend, before playing 90 minutes against PSG. “The groin problem for Lamine Yamal has returned following the game against PSG. The player will miss (Sunday’s) game against Sevilla and his recovery time is estimated at 2-3 weeks,” Barcelona said. Yamal has made five appearances for Barça this season, scoring twice. Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 formation is not the cause of Manchester United’s struggles. United are recovering from decades of exploitation and the squad, fair in some areas and abominable in others, is only in mid-rebuild. Nevertheless, there are structural weaknesses inherent within the setup – most particularly underloads in midfield and out wide – which must be mitigated. But Antonio Conte managed it at Chelsea just as Oliver Glasner has done at Crystal Palace because, once a match begins, the players run about; what that looks like is dictated not by starting position, but principles. What are you up to this weekend? Reading the Guardian, and consuming all kinds of our sports content? Yes, I thought so. Thanks to Sky Sports Football for this handy statistic: Manchester United managers: first 33 league games Louis van Gaal 65pts José Mourinho 64pts Erik ten Hag 63pts Alex Ferguson 61pts David Moyes 57pts Ole Gunnar Solskjær 56pts Ruben Amorim 34pts Ouch. As for Amorim, Noah emailed earlier, wondering if Manchester United simply cannot afford to sack him. “If you consider all the layoffs of staff and other cost-cutting measures, as well as Amorim’s win record, his repeated attempts at begging to be fired … “That makes me wonder if United are in serious financial trouble and cannot afford to actually pay the cost of sacking him.” I suppose the financial difficulties are well-documented, and Jim Ratcliffe’s Ineos are struggling compared to a few years ago … but the club does generate an eye-watering amount of cash, too. I fancy they do see Amorim as the right man for the long-term, even if it doesn’t look that way now. Is Ange Postecoglou the villain of the piece in the Forest panto? Barry Glendenning investigates in today’s Football Daily: Oliver Glasner, the Crystal Palace gaffer, was asked about Adam “The English Pirlo” Wharton missing out on selection by Tuchel. “He explained that he wanted to keep the same squad. We have to accept it,” said Glasner. “We try to do the best of it. He’ll have a few days to rest, which is good for him, because we have a tight schedule.” Thank Heavens, it’s time for the predicted lineups in His Majesty’s Premier League this weekend: Manchester City’s men’s and women’s teams will wear black armbands and hold a minute’s silence at their respective fixtures as a mark of respect after the terrorist attack at a synagogue in the city on Thursday. Meanwhile, my take on England, Tuchel, and reporters trying to manufacture a headline or two about Jude Bellingham’s omission: I know this is controversial, but why not just accept that Tuchel picks the team, and the squad, let him get on with it, and stop trying to stir the excrement? Wishful thinking, I know. Thanks Barry. For some reason, this piece by Jonathan Liew – after Ange Postecoglou’s sacking by Tottenham in the summer – came to mind earlier. “There may never have been a manager better at defining his own terms of achievement; a managerial reign so evidently built upon a towering silo of nuclear-strength bullshit.” Handover: And on that amusing note, that’s all from me but Luke McLaughlin is here to see you down the home straight. Have a great weekend and good luck to your team, whoever they might be, unless they’re Manchester United, who are playing the mighty Sunderland. Everton: An Everton-supporting pensioner has been banned from the club’s new ground after appearing in court charged with theft from Goodison Park, according to the Liverpool Echo. Following Everton’s penultimate home game of the season against Ipswich in May, he and other match-going co-conspirators are alleged to have tried to liberate and steal a row of seats from Goodison Park as mementos. The man in question, who I won’t name in the interests of sparing him further blushes, had his charges dropped after it was revealed in court that he had reached an informal resolution with the Everton to make a donation to their charity. He has also been banned from their new stadium until at least the end of this season. Upon hearing about the ban, Judge Neil Flewitt KC wryly observed that this “may or may not be a punishment”. Zing! Everton: It should go without saying that Everton’s manager has been asked about Jack Grealish’s latest omission from Thomas Tuchel’s latest England squad and the Scot says he still thinks the Everton winger can force his way into the German’s thinking ahead of the World Cup, if he can maintain the levels of form he has shown since moving to Merseyside on loan. “I am glad I don’t pick the England team because the England squad is a great group of players to choose from, really top players all around the country,” he said. “Jack is one of them, he is in really good form but I am glad I don’t pick the England team. He is showing the levels he can get too and we are hoping he continues with that. I believe he will be ready, he needs to continue on scoring goals and making assists.” Everton host Crystal Palace at Hill Dickenson Stadium on Sunday. Wolverhampton Wanderers: Having secured their first point of the season with a draw at Tottenham last weekend, Vitor Pereira will be hoping his side can beat Brighton at Molineux on Sunday so he can visit his local, the Inn at Shipley, for a couple of long overdue celebratory pints with Wolves fans. While Brighton are no mugs and every game is difficult when you’re bottom of the table, the visitors’ up-and-down form so far this season means a Wolves victory wouldn’t be a massive shock. Pereira has told reporters that Toti Gomes is out with a dose of the flu, while Jorgen Strand Larsen is “still struggling”. He also said that the Wolves summer signing Tolu Arokodare, who opened his account against Everton in the Carabao Cup, is also a little way off full fitness. “Larsen is is struggling with injury, he needs to be fully fit,” he said. “He’s not the Larsen that you used to see pressing, fighting, because got some pain and he’s struggling with his injury. He’s trying to help the team in this important moment, but he’s not in his best level. “Tolu, because the pre-season was without games when he started to work with us he was not ready to start a game. But we needed him to start at Newcastle. He tried his best, scored a beautiful goal against Everton, but he is not yet in his best shape.” Cardiff City: Rubin and Joel Colwill grew up vandalising their mother’s fixtures and fittings, perfecting two-touch moves in the garden and sleeping in bunk beds in the family home. Now the Welsh brothers are starring for the club they both support. Interview: Ben Fisher Scottish Premiership: With Hearts top of the table after six games, Rangers in a state of total chaos and Celtic looking far more vulnerable than usual despite having dropped just four points, the sight of the Scottish Premiership table is almost certainly prompting double-takes all over the world as things currently stand. One of four unbeaten teams in the division, Motherwell currently sit fourth and could really put the cat among the pigeons with a win over the reigning champions on at Celtic Park on Sunday. The Steelmen have not won at Celtic’s ground in almost 10 years but their head coach Jens Berthel Askou says his side are bang up for the challenge this weekend despite being rank outsiders. “I think there’s opportunities in any league, every year, if you do things right,” said the Dane in his pre-match presser. “And if you are consistent and brave and stick to what you believe, [that] is what will bring you success over time. Knowing that we are competing against clubs who have had more time together than us, who have more resources than us, it’s no excuse to not be competitive and ambitious. And that’s what we try to do. “We know it’s going to be really, really hard to get a top position in the league when the league is over but we are going for it with everything we can. And Sunday is going to be a big game for us to show that we are serious when we say we are here to compete. It’s the key message every time we go to play a football game. We want to win and we try to set up the team with the belief that they can win. We try to play the way we play, with respect for the opponent and what their strengths are. “Obviously, Celtic is a top team that has many strengths that we have to deal with. But it’s also a team that, like everyone else, there are possibilities. If we find our best level, then we have the ability to hurt any team in the league.” Tottenham Hotspur: While Andrews is plotting City’s demise, his predecessor at Brentford has been singing the praises of Leeds United, who host Thomas Frank’s Tottenham Hotspur in tomorrow’s lunchtime kick-off. “I think Leeds have done very well since they have got promoted,” said the Dane, whose side have drawn their past two league games and go into tomorrow’s encounter on the back of a Champions League draw against Bodø/Glimt they were extremely fortunate to scrape. “Elland Road is one of the best games to go to because the atmosphere is always great. Clearly, they have been very good at home. They give very little away in open play. It could be 90 minutes back and forth.” Frank told reporters that Cristian Romero is fit and available for tomorrow’s match after missing out on the trip to the Arctic Circle with a foot injury. Dominic Solanke has undergone a surgical procedure on a foot issue of his own and will be out until after the international break, while Randal Kolo Muani has been back on the grass for the past couple of days “so that’s good news”. Brentford: While tactically outwitting the current iteration of Manchester United managed by Ruben Amorim is hardly up there with splitting the atom, Keith Andrews did exactly that in fine style when Brentford beat them at the Gtech Community Stadium last Saturday. Andrews will be hoping for a repeat performance against Pep Guardiola and Manchester City when their team coach pulls up at the famous bus stop in Hounslow on Saturday. “It is us as a club and our team against theirs,” said the Dubliner at his pre-match press conference. “It is about the players and how we can prepare them to go into a really, really tough game against a top, top manager and top players who have world-class ability. It is about how we can nullify that and stop that, as well as cause them real problems.” Brentford winger Fabio Carvalho should be in contention on Sunday having missed the win over United with a minor knee injury, while Reiss Nelson has also resumed training following an illness. Sunderland: Speaking of Regis, despite his side’s splendid start to the season in which they have already picked up 11 points and established themselves as genuine title contenders, the Frenchman is not satisfied and thinks his side players to give him more. Speaking ahead of tomorrow afternoon’s statement win against Manchester United, Le Bris said his side will need to “upgrade their performance” at Old Trafford. “It’s better to start with confidence and points and the feeling that we can be competitive in the league, even if it’s tough and every game is different,” he said. “It’s really clear that it is collective work and everyone has their own role and it’s important to value, even the small tasks. I still believe that we’ll need to upgrade our performance to be competitive in Manchester. They are strong, create many chances from everywhere, direct play in behind, set-pieces, with talented players. So for us the only thing we can control is our way of playing, the way we want to play this game, to face this challenge, being aware that it will be tough.” Sunderland’s most recent victory at Old Trafford came in May 2014, when the Swedish midfielder Sebastian Larsson scored the only goal of the game. Nottingham Forest: Just six games into his tenure as Forest head coach and Ange Postecoglou can’t buy a win for love or money and already looks like a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders. Asked what it is he thinks he needs to do to get Forest back to winning ways, he had this to say. “As i said last night, we are not dealing with key moments in games very well. Certainly last night we conceded a really poor first goal from a set-piece. We have got back into the game and then literally from kick-off they have had a set-piece and we just didn’t deal with it well. “We are having to chase games a fair bit and while we are creating opportunities we are not being as ruthless as we can be to see out games. It’s a combination of things that we need to fix.” With games against Newcastle, Chelsea, Porto, Bournemouth and Manchester United coming up, it will intriguing to see if the Australian will be given more than a month to fix it. A win at St James’ Park against a Newcastle side who have been fairly inconsistent this season would certainly help his cause. Personally, I think Forest fans have jumped the gun in calling for Postecoglou’s head already. While I was delighted to see my team, Sunderland, beat them last weekend, I thought Regis Le Bris’s side were lucky to take all three points. Sunderland scored from a free-kick that should never have been awarded, Forest played better on the night and but for the heroics of the Mackems’ goalkeeper Robin Roefs, they would probably have won quite easily. Other opinions are available. World Cup ticket prices: England fans have criticised the “astonishing” price of tickets for next summer’s World Cup - which could rise further with demand. Tickets first became accessible on Wednesday to those selected in a draw held last month, with The Athletic reporting that $60 tickets (£44.60) - which Fifa said would be the cheapest on offer - were extremely scarce. Fifa has not confirmed starting prices for the tickets beyond the cheapest group stage ticket and the most expensive for the final, but the England Fans’ Embassy estimates that a fan attending every England match if they made it to the final - even buying tickets in the cheapest category - would spend at least $3,180 (£2,364). Fifa is operating what it describes as variable pricing for the tournament, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico, meaning prices could rise - or drop - depending on demand. “These prices are astonishing - $2,000 dollars for the cheapest final ticket is unacceptable,” said Thomas Concannon from the England Fans’ Embassy. “If fans are successful in obtaining a category four ticket from the first game to the last, that could set them back $3,180 dollars at least. That is more than double what Qatar cost. “Combined with travel to the Americas and accommodation, this will be the most expensive World Cup for match-going fans we’ve ever seen by some distance. A healthy allocation of the lowest category of tickets should be made available to participating nations that are not affected by host city location or dynamic pricing. Additionally, participating nation tickets should be located in key areas directly behind the goals to provide the best possible backing to their teams. We’d urge the FA to work with other nations around the world to put pressure on Fifa to keep this World Cup financially accessible for matchgoing fans.” The Athletic also reported on Friday that Fifa would charge a 15 per cent commission on tickets bought and sold on its official resale platform. They reported that some tickets were already on sale for tens of thousands of dollars. England need two more wins in qualifying to guarantee their place at the finals next summer. Leeds United: Joel Piroe was the subject of interest from other clubs during the summer but the striker insisted he wanted to stay at Leeds and “perform in the Premier League”. Piroe has since got his wish but only up to a point. After starting against Everton and Arsenal, the 26-year-old has not been picked since playing in his side’s embarrassing Carabao Cup exit at the hands of Sheffield Wednesday. He will, however, be delighted to hear that his manager has bigging him up no end ahead of Leeds’ match against Tottenham Hotspur ast Elland Road tomorrow. “For me, he’s the best finisher I’ve ever worked with and there’s been some good finishers,” said Daniel Farke of the Dutchman. “If you want to have a player with the ball in front of his feet 20 yards out, then I would always go for Joel Piroe because he’s an unbelievable finisher and in these terms, really world class. Sometimes different skills are asked for. In the last [few] games, it was bit more than a few other skills that we needed in order to be effective as a team. “And of course, it’s difficult because we won’t, can’t take it out of him to become a completely different player and I don’t want this because I want him exactly this way. He’s more a player who’s not like the physical target striker, where you play balls into him and he holds the ball. He’s smart in his movements when there is a bit more space. He can also play as a No10. Sometimes he can play behind one striker, who creates a bit space, and then he goes into the holes and finishes. I’m 100 per cent sure that during the season the skills and the strength of Joel Piroe will be needed, definitely.” For now, however, it seems Piroe remains behind Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Lukas Nmecha in the Leeds pecking order. That’s all from me for now – Barry Glendenning is stepping in. Ange continues, on Forest’s travails. What is the plan and style he’s trying to implement? “I’d be surprised if anyone hasn’t seen a change. Results to one side … There is plenty of evidence that we have changed fundamentally the way we go about things, in terms of the way we set up, the possession we have, the chances we create, how aggressive we are with and without the ball. That’s always a work in progress, and we are still in a stage of discovery around players … “I would be very surprised if anyone thought it would be an overnight sort of thing. But because results haven’t followed there’s a question mark … “I’ve always felt results are the paramount thing. I wouldn’t get the team to play the way I want unless I thought it would win games of football. That’s why I set up the team the way I do. I never sacrifice a result to develop a playing style … how quickly I implement things, that slows down as a process [when results are bad]. “It’s our lack of focus in key moments. Maybe that’s a consequence of the change in everything?” “It’s raw and fresh,” Postecoglou says of last night’s European defeat for Forest. “We’ve reviewed it and given feedback to the players. That’s the reality of football … it’s really important we start to prepare for a difficult game on Sunday [Newcastle on away]. “We are not dealing with key moments in games really well. We conceded a poor goal from a set-piece [last night] … we’re having to chase games a fair bit. “While again, we are creating opportunities, we’re not being as ruthless as we can be to see out games. It’s a combination of things we need to fix.” Set pieces seem to be a big problem? “It was disappointing last night … I wasn’t happy at half-time. In the second half they had six or seven more set-pieces and didn’t get “first contact” on any of them. We didn’t change anything, it was just a change of mindset.” Does he feel under pressure going into the international break? “Look, I get it. It’s a valid sort of assumption in modern football that there is always a a manager under pressure. That is just part and parcel of what we do – but I just don’t think that way. “Put it this way. I knew I was going to get sacked at Tottenham three or four months before I did. And that didn’t stop me winning something. It doesn’t enter my head. My responsibility lies with making sure this football club progresses … if I worry about what’s going to happen next week, I’m not performing the role I’ve been given … the things I control are the environment, training, the way we play … and I’m very strong in my belief that we’re not too far away.” Ruben Amorim is asked why Manchester United fans should keep the faith, given ongoing poor form and results. “It’s not time to say,” he says. “It’s time to show. I can look at the games in this year [season], for me, they are completely are different. There are some things that are the same … it’s other things we cannot change. “We show “that thing” in certain games. In certain games we are not the same team in certain details. I have nothing to say in this moment. My job is to prepare the team, and let’s go for the next game.” “It’s a crazy world we are living in at the moment,” says the United manager, Ruben Amorim, of yesterday’s deadly attack on the synagogue in Manchester. “A lot of these things happening. Of course our sympathy for the victims. We will pay tribute to the victims tomorrow. But it’s a crazy world in this moment.” Amorim’s side host Sunderland at 3pm. The Italy manager Gennaro Gattuso has recalled midfielder Bryan Cristante for this month’s World Cup qualifiers against Estonia and Israel, but Liverpool’s Federico Chiesa has again been left out. Per Reuters … Gattuso has included the uncapped Fiorentina midfielder Hans Nicolussi Caviglia and Bologna forward Nicolo Cambiaghi, along with Milan defender Matteo Gabbia. Cristante has played 43 times for Italy, but the Roma player has not been a part of the current campaign, with his last cap coming at Euro 2024. Chiesa’s last cap also came at Euro 2024 and, while the winger has only come off the bench in the Premier League this season, he has scored twice for Liverpool. Italy have won both games since Gattuso took over, a 5-0 thumping of Estonia last month followed by a dramatic 5-4 win over Israel. The Italians face those two sides again as they bid to reach the World Cup having missed the last two tournaments. Norway top Group I with 15 points, six ahead of Italy who have a game in hand. Israel are level on nine points with the Italians and have played a game more. The group winners qualify automatically, with the runners-up going into the playoffs. Italy are away to Estonia on October 11 and host Israel three days later in Udine. Tomorrow is Arteta’s 300th game in charge of Arsenal. “All I can say is thank you. I enjoy every minute of it. I hope many more to come.” What would make the next 300 games a success? “Even with this win-rate [over 50% during Arteta’s tenure] we haven’t won major trophies. This level is not enough. That is what we will try to focus on doing.” Arsenal injury update: “We weren’t too concerned about Gabriel,” Arteta says of the defender who was withdrawn against Olympiaco. “That hasn’t changed. “Hincapie will be available after the international break … this [game] came too fast.” Is he proud of England manager Thomas Tuchel praised Myles Lewis-Skelly? Yes! He is! “Very much. Coming from Thomas, someone I know very well, for him to describe Myles in that way – credit to his family, to the boy, everyone involved with his development … “He is professional in the way he engages with the team, you can always count on him.” Arteta is here! The Gunners are playing West Ham tomorrow. Ange Postecoglou is yet to taste success, becoming the first Forest head coach in a century to fail to win any of their first six games. There was a poisonous atmosphere at the City Ground on Thursday night as they succumbed to the second-best team in Denmark. When supporters are calling for your sacking after 23 days, it is fair to say things are not going well. On Friday, though, there were no plans to dismiss Postecoglou. Please, please, please send me an email. Postecoglou. Arteta. Moyes. All these legends and more still to come. The best moment from Pep’s press conference had to be this, though: Reporter: “Rodri came off the other night, and you conceded that late equaliser.” Pep: “Are you suggesting they scored because Nico González was in the pitch and not Rodri? How do you know that?” Reporter: “I can’t prove it.” Pep: “Me neither. So, change the subject.” Classically snippy Pep! Re: today’s hot topic. I felt Postecoglou was a bizarre appointment for Forest given Tottenham’s Premier League struggles last season. From what I’ve seen recently (a bit of the defeat by Sunderland and a bit of last night’s debacle) Forest are attacking in incredibly predictable fashion, are relatively easy to defend against, and have basically fallen apart as a defensive unit. It’s all a long way from the glory days of last season. Mikel Arteta of “The Arsenal” is said to be speaking at 1.15pm. They play West Ham tomorrow at 3pm. Thanks John. Hi everyone. I also caught Pep’s press conference before Brentford v Manchester City on Sunday. He was asked if he watched the Ryder Cup last weekend? “Oh yeah. What a Sunday. First of all congratulations to Luke Donald and his guys. It’s not easy to beat the USA in New York. But oh God, last day, everybody was thinking … [the USA could come back]. “I listened to an interview with Shane Lowry. He said it was “the worst six hours of my life”. If they say that, after playing the Masters, Opens, US Opens and everything … The Ryder Cup is like that. “They [the European team] play against incredible, top players. But they were resilient. I was surprised. That’s a sporting lesson: It’s done when it’s done. You lose the Premier League when you lose the Premier League. Not before. You win, you win it. Otherwise anything can happen. Sport is so difficult. But really pleased that Europe showed character again and they could win.” Chance now to hand over the blog duties to Luke McLaughlin. Plenty of pressers to come this afternoon. Manchester United will hold a minute’s silence and the players will wear black armbands as a mark of respect after the terrorist attack at a synagogue in the city on Thursday. Pep Guardiola is speaking ahead of that Brentford game for Manchester City. The subject falls to Phil Foden’s absence from the England squad soon enough. “Thomas knows what he needs for the national team a thousand time, million times, trillion times better than me. All I can say that if Phil continues playing like he is playing then he will be back. I am happy that players go to the national team, but I am even more happy when they come back healthy, that’s for sure.” Guardiola on the new Brentford: “Quite similar with Thomas Frank. They are doing really well so it is a tough place to go, Brentford, and always has been. At the same time, we are looking forward to the last game before the international break and will do what we have to do.” The Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles with the launch of its first daily football game, On the ball. It is now live in the app for both iOS and Android … so what are you waiting for? There are no plans for a minute’s silence to be held before this weekend’s Premier League and English Football League fixtures as a mark of respect for the victims of Thursday’s terrorist attack at a synagogue in Manchester. Individual clubs are able to organise tributes if they wish to do so but there has been no directive from the leagues. The Football Association is yet to clarify whether there will be a tribute before England’s men play Wales in a friendly at Wembley next Thursday. Brentford face Manchester City on Sunday. Here’s a piece on how Keith Andrews is going so far as their rookie manager. Eddie Howe has confirmed that Yoane Wissa will be absent for some time yet with the injury he sustained when playing for DR Congo: ““Yoane saw a specialist again yesterday for a check-up on his knee. We probably think now it’ll be eight weeks rather than six. No recurrence or problem, just slightly longer.” Rodrigo Bentancur has signed a new deal to stay at Tottenham. The Uruguay international joined Spurs at the start of 2022 from Juventus. He said: “I feel really good and I’m very happy to continue my story with this fantastic club. My family are happy; I have fantastic friends and team-mates who work hard every day. I love this club and feel really good here. Winning the Europa League was a fantastic moment and we want to build on this now, to win more trophies. “We have a new head coach, a new captain (Cristian Romero) and I want to enjoy many more years at the club.” More Tuchel, who is showing off the difficulties of having so many players to choose from: “Phil Foden is in a very good moment. Adam Wharton deserves to be with us. Curtis Jones and Trevoh Chalobah are getting minutes with their clubs. There are players who deserve to be here. Cole Palmer is injured who is a special player. It will always be like this.” “What happens if Jude Bellingham or Cole Palmer get injured before a World Cup? We have to find solutions and I think we have in the last camp. This is more about last camp and what we started to build rather than the dependency on individual players. “Declan Rice, John Stones, Harry Kane - we can have influential injuries. You can never depend on one player.” Here’s a statement on the World Cup ticket prices from England’s Football Supporters Association (FSA). Thomas Concannon, who leads the FSA’s England Fans’ Embassy, said: These prices are astonishing – $2,000 for the cheapest final ticket is unacceptable. If fans are successful in obtaining a category four ticket from the first game to the last, that could set them back $3,180 at least. That is more than double what Qatar cost. Combined with travel to the Americas and accommodation, this will be the most expensive World Cup for matchgoing fans we’ve ever seen by some distance. A healthy allocation of the lowest category of tickets should be made available to participating nations that are not affected by host city location or dynamic pricing. Additionally, participating nation tickets should be located in key areas directly behind the goals to provide the best possible backing to their teams. We’d urge the FA to work with other nations around the world to put pressure on Fifa to keep this World Cup financially accessible for matchgoing fans.” More from Tuchel: “Bellingham always deserves to be in the camp” but “he has not fully gathered his rhythm at Real Madrid and has only started one match so is not back to full strength.” “There is also no problem between me and Jack Grealish and me and Phil Foden. “Phil is back influencing and deciding games for Manchester City. Jack is very close to being back to the best version of himself. “There is no personal problem. “These were not awkward conversations [with players]. They were straightforward conversations. “The last camp was only three and a half weeks ago and the team work and spirit was on the highest level. That is why we decided to invite the same group to this camp. “There are players out who deserve to be with us and they can get back in through performance. This is the best and most straightforward decision.” “To just be a good citizen in camp will not be enough,” says Tuchel, in relation to Myles Lewis-Skelly. “We accelerated his career.” “There are some players who deserve to be with us,” says Tuchel, who has praised Foden, Grealish and Wharton. He’s decided to keep largely the same squad as “they deserve to be in camp”. Press conference with Thomas Tuchel. Thomas Tuchel says Jude Bellingham has not been called up because he lacks “rhythm” due to a lack of games. “He wanted to be called up, he just lacks rhythm.” How long will Russell Martin last? Rangers lost 2-1 to Sturm Graz, and he had this to say. “The difference from the first half-hour to the next 60 minutes was too far apart really,” the head coach said. “It’s concentration, it’s mentality. “I’m frustrated because we give away two poor goals, soft goals. We did so much work on them recently. We were just not alive. We hurt ourselves because they didn’t create anything from open play. It’s hurtful and frustrating.” Some scathing words for someone or other at Manchester United from Antony, their former winger, now at Real Betis. Antony was speaking to ESPN Brasil: “I’m not the kind of guy who gets involved in controversies, who names people, in fact, I won’t mention anyone’s name here. “But I think there was a bit of a lack of respect there, even a bit of rudeness too, with no one giving you a ‘good morning’, a ‘good afternoon’. “Not even that. But, anyway, that’s in the past, I won’t give much importance to these things. Now I’m here, at Betis, I’m living here, that’s the most important thing for me. I am a man who accepts my responsibilities. I think off-field matters affected me a lot, in my performance. I know my potential, I know my qualities, I didn’t play in a World Cup for nothing, I didn’t return to the national team for nothing. “I also take responsibility for it not working out, for not performing as I wanted. But I always try to see the bright side of things, going through this entire process, this time at United, was necessary to see myself.” Another international manager with his selections being questioned is Mauricio Pochettino for the USMNT. Here’s Jacob Steinberg’s snap report on that Tuchel selection. Thomas Tuchel is due to speak at 11am. No Bellingham, no Foden, no Grealish, no Wharton. Some explaining to do? Noni Madueke and Tino Livramento are both missing with injury. From the last squad, Jarell Quansah and Bukayo Saka come in. Goalkeepers: Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace), Jordan Pickford (Everton), James Trafford (Manchester City) Defenders: Dan Burn (Newcastle United), Marc Guéhi (Crystal Palace), Reece James (Chelsea), Ezri Konsa (Aston Villa), Myles Lewis-Skelly (Arsenal), Jarell Quansah (Bayer Leverkusen), Djed Spence (Tottenham Hotspur), John Stones (Manchester City) Midfielders: Elliot Anderson (Nottingham Forest), Morgan Gibbs-White (Nottingham Forest), Jordan Henderson (Brentford), Ruben Loftus-Cheek (Milan), Declan Rice (Arsenal), Morgan Rogers (Aston Villa) Forwards: Jarrod Bowen (West Ham United), Eberechi Eze (Arsenal), Anthony Gordon (Newcastle United), Harry Kane (Bayern Munich), Marcus Rashford (Barcelona, loan from Manchester United), Bukayo Saka (Arsenal), Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa) Ben Fisher has been speaking to a key summer signing for Bournemouth, who appear to be even better than last season. Arne Slot has admitted: “We need to do better.” He’s been speaking about Alexander Isak: “I said to him when he started, the difficult thing will be you will have the appearances, but if you add the minutes together he will only have two or three appearances. That’s a situation we had from him, not training at Newcastle. But he still has a goal. The main thing is him adjusting to his new team-mates and his new team-mates adjusting to him.” As of 9am this morning, Nottingham Forest had no plans to sack Ange Postecoglou but the unpredictable nature of the club and its owner Evangelos Marinakis means that things can change quickly. The fans made their voices known on Thursday, calling for the exit of the man who replaced an East Midlands hero and it is difficult to turn the tide once that happens. Postecoglou is Marinakis’ man, the owner having lined him up long before Nuno Espirito Santo was sent packing. Everyone at Forest expected a period of transition but to be winless in six matches and losing at home to Sunderland and Midtjylland were not part of the thoughts when he arrived last month. The Australian was always going to change the style but he has his way of playing, which is very different to his predecessor, so there is an acceptance that these things take time. Patience, however, is not a trait often seen at Forest. The next three Premier League games are against Newcastle, Chelsea and Bournemouth, so things are not going to get easier for Postecoglou. Arne Slot has been speaking to the media: “Alisson is not part of the squad tomorrow and he won’t travel to Brazil for the national team. Hugo [Ekitike] is going to train again today, let’s see where he is. The same can be said for Frederico [Chiesa]. It depends on how fast the recovery goes. “I will be surprised if he [Alisson] will be there for the first game after the international break. From there on things can go a bit faster a bit slower. It’s difficult to say. I’m not a doctor so I cannot tell you if it is the same injury.” Giorgi Mamardashvili will play instead of Alisson. “I think we’ve seen against Southampton how well he’s adjusted. We knew we were bringing in a very good goalkeeper. When he plays his first game that’s a way of seeing he’s adjusted really well to our club. It’s not a surprise because he’s a quality goalkeeper. Now he can do what we’ve had to do so many times in the past replacing Alisson, like we’ve done so many times before.” Here’s our usual lookahead, including to tonight’s game at Bournemouth. Unbeaten in the league since their Friday night opener at Anfield, Bournemouth’s early momentum has been stalled by consecutive draws: at home to Newcastle and at Leeds last week. Fulham visit the Vitality on Friday, offering Andoni Iraola’s side a presentable chance of recapturing winning ways and going second in the table. After a turbulent summer, Iraola has sought consistency in his team selection. Trailing 2-1 at Leeds, the Bournemouth manager made a triple change to restore three usual starters – David Brooks, Alex Scott and Marcus Tavernier – to his XI and was rewarded with a late leveller. Bournemouth have also maintained defensive stability, conceding just once in four games between the trips to Liverpool and Leeds. Marcos Senesi, often playing in an otherwise brand-new back five, has been key to the team’s continuity. The centre-back earned praise from Iraola for his defensive work and threat at attacking set-pieces – as evidenced by his headed assist for Eli Junior Kroupi’s equaliser at Elland Road. Niall McVeigh It was a good night for the other English clubs in Europe. And a bad night for the Scottish clubs. Ben Fisher was at the City Ground last night to see the fans turn on Big Ange. The scenes were close to extraordinary on a sobering evening, thousands of home supporters singing: “You’re getting sacked in the morning.” Then the same fans twisted the knife a little deeper, singing the name of his predecessor Nuno Espírito Santo, with several turning towards Evangelos Marinakis, the owner watching on with his own giant private television in the directors’ box. This made for grim viewing. All is not well at Nottingham Forest. In fact, it’s not working out at all for Ange Postecoglou. Being barracked after six games is going some. Such is the wisdom of sacking a folk hero in Nuno. We’ll have reaction to that, and the rest of the Europa action ahead of a full Premier League weekend.

‘He’s behind you!’ Is Postecoglou the real villain in Nottingham Forest’s panto?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/03/football-daily-newsletter-ange-postecoglou-nottingham-forest,"OH NO HE ISN’T! OH YES HE IS! Arguably the most unpopular Australian to pitch up in Nottinghamshire since villainous hotelier Paul Robinson from Neighbours starred in a Mansfield panto 20 years ago, Ange Postecoglou’s reign at the City Ground could scarcely have got off to a more inauspicious start. While the boos and catcalls that actor Stefan Dennis was subjected to during Robin Hood and the Babes in the Wood were largely good-natured, such was the toxicity of the invective aimed at Postecoglou during Nottingham Forest’s Bigger Vase defeat by Midtjylland on Thursday, that it is difficult to imagine the man who has been in charge for just six matches will still be around to hear the festive cat-calls this Christmas. On more than one occasion the 60-year-old’s shouts of “He’s behind you!” went ignored by his hapless players, not least when the Danish side scored their first two goals from atrociously defended set-pieces. Far from the celebratory mood they’d hoped for, Forest’s first European home game in 29 years ended in rancour with home fans telling Postecoglou he’d be “sacked in the morning”, before serenading his popular, recently dismissed predecessor, Nuno Espírito Santo. “I get the mood around the place isn’t going to be great, I understand people’s attitude, particularly towards me, but I never worry about that, it’s not unfamiliar territory for me,” Postecoglou growled in response, while subjecting the floor around his feet to the now customary death-stare. “Nothing surprises me in football, it’s the climate we’re in. It seems that’s the way things are going. It’s nothing I can control. The fans are disappointed, they are allowed to have an opinion on it. I heard their opinion.” And while those Forest fans are entitled to vent, it could be argued that they might be better advised picking a more appropriate target for their ire. After all, it was Evangelos Marinakis who sacked a firm fan favourite to bring in Postecoglou, who was always going to begin his reign on a hiding to nothing. Looking on from the directors’ box as he went through a repertoire of surly, dark scowls not seen since that time he heard Spurs had triggered Morgan Gibbs-White’s release clause, the Greek tycoon has thus far mostly avoided any kind of serious criticism from fans, a fair few of whom remain convinced the sun shines out of his generously upholstered nether regions. As the clock ticked past noon on Friday, rumours of Postecoglou getting sacked in the morning proved to be greatly exaggerated and reports suggest his job remains safe until such time as … well, it isn’t. While the Forest head coach can argue with some mitigation that he has had little or no time on the training ground to instil the philosophy and tactical nuance that led to Tottenham Hotspur losing 22 of their 38 top-flight games last season, his side’s schedule remains forbidding and relentless. With Newcastle, Chelsea, Porto and Bournemouth next up it is difficult to see from where a first Postecoglou win will come before what could surely be the mother of all El Sackicos against Manchester United.

QUOTE OF THE DAY “I’m not the kind of guy who gets involved in controversies, who names people, in fact, I won’t mention anyone’s name here. But I think there was a bit of a lack of respect there, even a bit of rudeness too, with no one giving you a ‘good morning’, a ‘good afternoon’” – Antony takes a pop at Manchester United over the frosty environment at Old Trafford, where conviviality has seemingly headed south like the team’s form. FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS Is it true Ange Postecoglou has promised Forest fans he always wins a match in his second season?” – Pete Negri. Far be it for me to want to amplify the trope that Arsenal supporters are football’s whiniest fans, but Thabo Caves (yesterday’s Football Daily letters) does make you wonder. Pointing out that rather than two games a week, Arsenal are having to play 2.33 games a week (ooh an extra 30 minutes!) over a specific three-week period (for a squad with two good options for every position to boot) is not the debate-ender he might imagine. Rather it’s just going to have the orchestra of the world’s smallest violins tuning up their instruments once more, while the rest of football rolls their collective eyes” – Andrew Parker. I can’t work out whether your recent correspondents (on two or three games a week) are consciously, ironically recreating one of the high points of internet discourse (SFW), or unconsciously proving Marx’s adage about historical events repeating themselves as farce” – Nick Wiltsher. If it’s any solace, Bob Cushion (yesterday’s letters), I’ve always been like that [wanting wealthy English teams to lose in Europe]. Since Forest lost the ability to negotiate Europe, Uefa football for me has induced a state of seething impotent rage, punctuated only occasionally by Steaua Bucharest and, at a push, Zaragoza. I care not one jot for Liverpool’s exploits from the 80s right up to Istanbul. I am unmoved by ‘that night in Barcelona’, always support anyone who plays Chelsea, because, well, Chelsea have never given me many reasons not to hate them, and I can’t be bothered to tot up how many pots Citeh win while we sort out this finances thing. Yes, I’ll get behind the Palaces of this world and could always back Leeds, but no-one whose name contains the word ‘Dynamo’ are ever going to win anything. Ever again. So you might as well turn it off and go to an actual match. I also always hope Brighton get rinsed, but I’m working through that with a therapist” – Jon Millard.

Time to be brave: the tactical tweaks Amorim needs to make at Manchester United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/03/ruben-amorim-manchester-united-tactics-changes-formation-analysis,"Accept things need adjusting Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 formation is not the cause of Manchester United’s struggles. United are recovering from decades of exploitation and the squad, fair in some areas and abominable in others, is only in mid-rebuild. Nevertheless, there are structural weaknesses inherent within the setup – most particularly underloads in midfield and out wide – which must be mitigated. But Antonio Conte managed it at Chelsea just as Oliver Glasner has done at Crystal Palace because, once a match begins, the players run about; what that looks like is dictated not by starting position, but principles. Amorim said recently: “The problem is not the system, the problem is the results,” which is like blaming sick for ruining the carpet, rather than the teenager cuddling an empty bottle of cider. Opponents have been exploiting the same holes in his team for nearly a year, not because the players can’t grasp what he wants, but because what he wants is full of holes. For that reason, there will be no eureka moment when everything suddenly clicks, just as it is already clear that expensive signings will not redeem the situation. Brentford are a case in point. Despite losing their manager and best players over the summer, they switched from 5-3-2 to 4-2-3-1 specifically to embarrass a United side who play the same way every game and look risible in them all. When Erik ten Hag arrived at Old Trafford, it quickly became clear that what worked in the Eredivisie would not work in the Premier League; his inability to adapt was the principal reason he failed. Now Amorim – who appears to have all the tools to succeed in the most demanding job in football, apart from the actual football – is doing likewise and, in the process, spurning the chance of a lifetime. For the first time in generations, the club have owners whose priority is winning, not enrichment. Bertrand Russell said he would never die for his beliefs because he might be wrong, but Amorim seems prepared to sacrifice himself for a creed that is demonstrably so: rather than relax his dogma to make United great again, he pledges unswerving loyalty to ideas that give him nothing back, wilfully and needlessly arranging painful regrets for his future self. He is on the edge. Change the job of the outside centre-backs Outside centre-backs are crucial in Amorim’s system: they carry the ball, make tackles, patrol channels, switch play, build play and augment attacks. One needn’t be Rinus Michels to wonder whether, if he has two players with the technical excellence, tactical intelligence and physical attributes to do so many different things, it wouldn’t make more sense to go with a back four and alleviate some midfield suffering instead of picking an extra defender. In the meantime, these centre-backs are being pinned by attackers who, simply by standing next to them, stop them from jumping into midfield challenges as the system requires. This means teams with three or four players in that area are able to play around United’s two, a situation that needs resolving urgently. But how? Amorim could have his centre-backs jump anyway – though if they fail to win the ball they are leaving a man free – or bring Matheus Cunha deeper, curtailing his attacking possibilities but making more of his ball-carrying. But the move that makes most sense is to alter United’s pressing structure, such as it is, from 3-1-6 or 3-2-5 to a more compact, balanced and robust 4-4-2. In that situation, the centre-backs need not jump because there would be midfielders ahead of them rather than a big space which needs filling, with more equal spacing also facilitating better ball retention and chance creation. Reintegrate Mainoo Amorim’s chaotic, direct, impatient style demands United empty midfield and spam long balls, relying on excellence rather than coherence to create scoring opportunities. And, though their high expected goals (xG) suggests their attack will soon click, the eye test tells us it is largely down to them winning three penalties and taking lots of low-probability shots. They seldom sustain attacks or create big chances – though the players are capable. The best teams control games by controlling tempo. United’s inability to do so is not entirely Amorim’s fault; reportedly, he wanted a midfielder in the summer, only for director of football Jason Wilcox to pull rank and buy a striker. But ignoring who is to blame – and there’s plenty to go around – the situation is unsustainable. Amorim’s preferred central pairing is Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, with Manuel Ugarte deputising when the former is unavailable. This means Kobbie Mainoo has barely played and, while the manager’s reservations are fair – he needs to get stronger and faster, as well as better at finding the ball and passing it forward – it is hard not to mistrust any system that excludes such a talent. Casemiro, Fernandes and Ugarte are, for different reasons, players who speed the game up, whereas Mainoo can slow it down. Amorim’s Sporting could pump the ball forward early because of the disparity in class between their attackers and the average Primeira Liga defence, and if they lost it, had the power to recover. But in the Premier League, the quality is such that teams who cede possession cheaply are punished, while physicality is everywhere, so can take a team only so far. United have started some games quickly, only to struggle thereafter because it’s impossible to play at breakneck pace for 90 minutes and they have no apparent alternative, barely attempting to circulate the ball and pull opponents out of position with runs and rotations. Mainoo’s ball manipulation is outstanding and, though partnering him with Fernandes is an imperfect solution, defensive weaknesses matter much less in a team who dominate possession. Given no side in the league are conceding, on average, as many high-quality chances as United, it is surely worth trying as the alternatives have been fully explored. While it is unclear what Mainoo can do in this system, the best way of improving him is playing him and it would be difficult for him to make things worse. Work with the wide players On United’s right, Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo are a combination that, in an attacking sense, should work, as both players are imaginative, intelligent and gritty, each able to fill the other’s role. Leny Yoro, when playing right centre-back, could form the third point of a triangle which should be a creative strength. At the moment, though, they rarely rotate, making it easy for opponents to stop them. Amorim must drill them to move the ball and themselves, keeping their markers guessing, while passes to them should not always be to feet because, from a standing start, it is much harder to commit defenders. Rather, delivery should arrive into stride or to meet a run, making it easier for them to cut inside, beat men and open lanes for passing or shooting. On the left, Patrick Dorgu receives the ball in dangerous areas far too often for someone so ill-equipped to exploit them. He should play slightly deeper, where his tackling and ball-carrying can be effective in supplying more reliable creators ahead of him, and he should also work on his crossing, a skill that can easily be improved with practice and at which, given Benjamin Sesko’s aerial prowess, it is essential he excels. Dare to be brave When Amorim has a decision to make, he regularly chooses the defensive option but, counterintuitively, the composition of his squad means attacking options are generally safer. In goal, we know for sure that Altay Bayindir is not good enough. As such, Senne Lammens should come in on the basis the only thing that can prepare him for playing in the Premier League is playing in the Premier League. At the back, he must trust Yoro and possibly Ayden Heaven, who impressed last season before getting injured. Meanwhile, at right-wingback, Diogo Dalot’s defending is nowhere near good enough for it to be preferred to Diallo’s attacking. Using him there also leaves the side, already struggling to create, a forward light. It is practical for Amorim to choose offensive options not just because of the technical makeup of his squad, but because he needs to fortify fragile confidence. When United led Chelsea 2-0 at half-time he replaced his centre-forward with a defensive midfielder, tacitly telling his team to sit on their lead while depriving them of the focal point and out-ball necessary for that. Similarly, after United lost last Saturday, Amorim lamented his team playing Brentford’s game. Yet by picking Harry Maguire ahead of Yoro, and asking them to go long rather than play through the thirds, he set them up to do so. The best United managers were gamblers; the league champions are almost always an attacking outfit; and it is pointless buying an expensive forward line, with one of the world’s best creators behind it, only to play like Dave Bassett’s Wimbledon."
Postecoglou faces losing popularity contest unless Forest find liftoff,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/03/postecoglou-faces-losing-popularity-contest-unless-nottingham-forest-find-liftoff,"Replacing a Nottingham Forest hero was never going to be easy but Nuno Espírito Santo did a very cunning thing after Steve Cooper’s sacking: he won his first two games. A lot is forgotten about the opening six months of Nuno’s tenure, when the team survived one place above the relegation zone and went through a period of winning once in 10 Premier League matches. Nuno had done the important thing of boosting morale and winning over the fans by defeating Newcastle away and creating excitement by beating Manchester United at home, and no one was clamouring for style points. The City Ground was rocking in late December 2023, and no home fans cared too much that they saw only two more victories there for the remainder of the season. Ange Postecoglou is yet to taste success, becoming the first Forest head coach in a century to fail to win any of their first six games. There was a poisonous atmosphere at the City Ground on Thursday night as they succumbed to the second-best team in Denmark. When supporters are calling for your sacking after 23 days, it is fair to say things are not going well. On Friday there were no plans to dismiss Postecoglou but a defeat at Newcastle on Sunday could cost him his job. Everyone at the club accepted there would be a period of transition because the Australian’s style of play is almost a polar opposite to the one Nuno finely tuned there. The plan was evolving under the Portuguese but not at the speed Postecoglou is trying to implement. Starting with four away games was always going to be a difficult ask for Postecoglou. Opening at Arsenal meant building momentum from the first whistle was unlikely but losing at Swansea in the Carabao Cup and drawing at Burnley put him on the back foot. The game at Real Betis appeared to be a turning point because the performance was impressive and fitting of expectations regarding Postecoglou’s style. The processes were correct and, but for a late Antony goal, takeoff would have commenced. Instead Forest remain grounded. If Postecoglou could have been forgiven for the away results, losing at home to Sunderland and Midtjylland was not part of the thinking. There was a degree of mitigation in the first City Ground defeat: a generous free-kick award that led to the winner and appalling finishing from Forest meant the points went back to the north‑east. Forest had almost two‑thirds of possession and 22 shots but outscoring an opponent on xG is meaningless. There was a hope that once the strikers found form, everything would be fine but poor finishing is only one of the problems facing Postecoglou. The robust defensive unit built by Nuno has been dismantled, leaving Postecoglou awaiting a clean sheet. Defending set pieces has been a problem, two of Midtjylland’s goals coming from them, and the other goal Forest conceded was from a counterattack, the sort that were a regular feature during Postecoglou’s time at Tottenham. Postecoglou was eager to return to work quickly after being sacked by Tottenham, especially with a Europa League winner’s medal around his neck. He wanted to prove people wrong and Forest offered that opportunity, with the added bonus of being in the competition he had won in May. The Greek connection with Forest’s owner, Evangelos Marinakis, helped make the appointment smooth and Postecoglou, despite his critics, does have the credentials required – but pragmatism was not likely to be involved. Nuno was not sacked for football reasons but for picking a fight with Marinakis that he was never going to win. Finishing seventh and taking Forest into Europe made Nuno incredibly popular. Despite his complaints, a squad capable of finishing in the top half was assembled and plenty of money was spent. After far too much short-termism at Forest, they had a clear long-term vision and strategy, which included a team that suited Nuno. Now it feels as if a stepdad has moved into the house and the children are not happy. Trips to Newcastle and Bournemouth bookend the visit of Chelsea in the next three league games, suggesting life is only going to get harder. Marinakis made the appointment with his heart and is desperately hoping to avoid another sacking because removing Postecoglou would be an admission that he made two dreadful decisions in dismissing Nuno and selecting the replacement. Football is one big popularity contest and Nuno started winning his at St James’ Park. Postecoglou needs to do the same or he risks losing his for good."
‘It’s crazy’: Colwill brothers go from bunk beds and face paint to Cardiff double act,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/03/colwill-brothers-cardiff-rubin-joel-interview,"The excitement is etched across the faces of Rubin and Joel Colwill as the brothers discuss playing together for Cardiff. As kids in Neath, about 30 miles north-west of the Welsh capital, they were regulars at Melyn Park, over the road from the family home, and spent hours perfecting two-touch skills in the back garden. “When we were small I got a marker pen and drew a goal on the hallway door and our mother was fuming,” Rubin says, both of them breaking into laughter. They are separated by two and a half years but have always been close and Joel, who turns 21 this month, was best man at Rubin’s wedding this year. Growing up they lived each other’s journeys, both associated with Cardiff from the age of seven, and their parents, Richard and Jodi, ferried them to training. They attended Ysgol Gyfun Ystalyfera, the same secondary school as Ben Davies, the Wales defender poised to win his 100th cap in their World Cup qualifier against Belgium on 13 October. Then there were the bunk beds. “Yeah, we had a lot of WWE matches on those,” Rubin says, smiling. There is a brilliant photo of the brothers, with Cardiff scarves and face-painted cheeks, beaming outside Wembley in 2012 before the Carling Cup final lost on penalties to Liverpool, for whom the Wales manager, Craig Bellamy, played as a substitute that day. “At the time iIt felt like we were going to Wembley almost every year,” Rubin, 23, says, alluding to two trips in 2008 and a playoff final in 2010. “What do you remember?” he asks his brother. “Having my top off, swinging it around inside Wembley,” Joel replies. They first played for Cardiff together two years ago, in a Carabao Cup win over Colchester, and the following month they both represented Wales Under‑21s against Liechtenstein. This, though, is different; the down-to‑earth duo at the heart of Cardiff’s resurgence after relegation, the club’s first season in the third tier since 2002-03. On the first day of the League One season, against Peterborough, they became the first brothers to begin a Cardiff game since Gary and Dave Bennett in 1983. Mel and John Charles, who played for Wales at the 1958 World Cup, are among the clutch of former Cardiff brothers. “It’s incredibly rare, especially to play for the same team, so we are really lucky,” Rubin says. “The pre‑match huddle just felt surreal,” Joel says. “I’d often been in the stands thinking: ‘One day, hopefully, I’ll be down there with him and we will play together.’” Joel scored his first Cardiff goal later in August. “When you assisted me against Cheltenham …” Joel says of it. “Yeah, that was special,” Rubin interjects, before his brother elaborates. “At the time I didn’t really think anything of it, but when I got home it hit me. The amount of times you have passed me the same ball at training or when we were kids. There are little things I’ve dreamed of like the scoreboards, online and on the apps, saying: ‘J Colwill [R Colwill]’ to show one of us assisted the other to score. For it to actually happen is crazy.” This is Joel’s breakthrough campaign at Cardiff, after fruitful loans at Cheltenham and Exeter last season, but Rubin has been heavily involved since flying on to the radar – on the international stage. A month after turning 19, and at the end of a season he began with Cardiff’s under-18s, Rubin was a wildcard call-up for Wales’s Euro 2020 squad. At the time he had played only 191 minutes of senior football. “I’d never really been around superstars – coming from Neath, the most normal place you can imagine,” Rubin says. “So then being with probably the greatest British player ever [Gareth Bale], Aaron Ramsey, Ben Davies, Chris Gunter, legends from Euro 2016 I’d watched in school … I had to remember they are normal people. It was almost hard to focus on training when Gareth Bale’s calling for the ball. A crazy time.” But was it the right time? “It did way more good than harm,” he insists. “The exposure, the experience. I had a really quick ascendancy and then almost felt like I’d lingered around without too much happening.” Playing together for Cardiff is one thing, but what about Wales? “That’s our next focus,” Rubin says. “As kids, the idea of playing for Cardiff together was unbelievable but playing for Wales … it almost felt unreachable. But it is within reach now. We both know we’re good enough, we’ve both been selected before, so it’s just a matter of us both staying focused. Hopefully in the near future the stars will align and it comes to fruition.” Joel won his first cap against Canada in Swansea last month, for which Rubin was in the stands, and has been called up to the squad to face England and Belgium , the former a friendly. Rubin is yet to build on his nine caps since Bellamy, who was his coach for a couple of years in Cardiff’s academy, succeeded Rob Page 14 months ago. “I’ve known Craig a long time,” Rubin says. “He’s one to push [players] to try and get the most out of them and I think he’s definitely trying to do that with me. Every time we speak he’s obviously watched my games and in the conversations we’ve had there’s always been a little thing he wants me to change or something to do better, so it’s up to me then to almost tick those things off and then it’s up to him if he wants to pick me.” Cardiff are fourth before hosting Leyton Orient on Saturday and seven academy graduates featured in their surprise defeat by Burton in midweek, including the latest Wales debutants in Dylan Lawlor, 19, and Ronan Kpakio, 18. “The manager’s been brilliant,” Rubin says of Brian Barry-Murphy, who previously coached at Manchester City’s academy. “The football is a bit different to what everybody is used to Cardiff playing and it’s been refreshing. “We are a group of young lads who have grown up watching this style on TV, the likes of Barcelona, Man City. It is easy to see the passing, the goals, the highlights‑reel stuff, but people often miss the hard yards, the pressing, the squeezing of the backline, all the tough running we did in pre-season to get us physically capable of doing what he wants. There’s going to be an adaptation period – and I think we’re still in that – because there’s so much more we can improve and we’re working every day to get there.” The pair can now chuckle about the 10-minute turnaround they mastered as schoolboys: get off the bus, race home, get changed, grab a sandwich and head to Cardiff training for 5pm in Treforest, in the heart of the south Wales valleys. “A crazy rush almost every day,” Rubin says. “It has all been worth it. But we don’t want this to be the pinnacle. “We want to keep doing what we’re doing, rise up the leagues with Cardiff, keep doing as well as we can. It’s important to recognise: ‘This is amazing.’ But we’re like: ‘This isn’t the end for us.’”"
"Brentford rise above snobbery to remain awkward, all-action opponents",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/03/brentford-rise-above-snobbery-awkward-all-action-opponents-keith-andrews,"Brentford represent a case study in what happens to the “well-run”, paragon club when their long-serving leader departs, along with key players. Can the processes that took the club so far weather such change? Can a much-admired analytics-based scouting system find workable replacements? Appointing a manager – Brentford use the title of head coach – with no frontline experience in Keith Andrews further stress-tests the strength of the framework. The signs thus far are mixed though positive on balance. As sainted as Thomas Frank is in the Brentford canon, the Dane leaving with the blessing of execs and fans to join Tottenham, progress was never linear or a fully upward curve. A club with a reported wage bill of £50m a season, among the lowest in the Premier League, have heavy tides to swim against. That last season’s 10th place came accompanied by disappointment in missing out on European football suggests how far expectations had risen. On Sunday Manchester City visit a team kicking off in the relative safety of 13th place, though with oscillations from losing 3-1 at Fulham a fortnight ago to a deserved 3-1 home defeat of Manchester United last Saturday. With the caveat that many find United a soft touch, and one of Frank’s final matches was a 4-3 defeat of Ruben Amorim’s team, beating them still carried cachet for Andrews; the week before he had returned to Dublin for the funeral of a United-supporting uncle. No club have beaten United and City in consecutive league matches since Tottenham in January 1996. Andrews was no stranger to Brentford. Last season, he patrolled the technical area as Frank’s set-piece specialist. Ipswich’s Kieran McKenna, Bodø/Glimt’s Kjetil Knutsen and Danny Röhl, then of Sheffield Wednesday, were linked. The likeliest internal candidate was assistant coach Justin Cochrane, but he followed Frank to Tottenham. The summer was a time of change on and off the field. Matthew Benham, the owner whose analytics approach follows his success in the sports betting sphere, sold a minority share to the former Autoglass chief executive and Labour party donor Gary Lubner and the film-maker Sir Matthew Vaughn, whose wife, Claudia Schiffer, has been attracting photographers to the directors’ box. The continuity at the club is provided by Jon Varney, the chief executive, and Phil Giles, the sporting director. Giles, who has been at the club for a decade, gave an interview last week to the Irish publication the 42, where he admitted Brentford can never rest on laurels with the management congratulating itself for jobs well done. “There is no such thing as established,” he said. “It’s not even a football word. When are we established? Probably never. Not a club our size, I don’t think you can ever take it for granted.” Brentford kicked off against United in 17th place, the survival position. Losing Frank, and leading players such as the forwards Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa, the midfielder and captain Christian Nørgaard plus the goalkeeper Mark Flekken, looked like a team’s heart being ripped out, an asset stripping by the carrion elite. Benham, Varney and Giles had a plan; Andrews inherited talent to work with. Igor Thiago was at the club, the previous summer’s big signing lost to Frank through injury. His four goals from 10 shots have come at the highest conversion rate of any Premier League player this season. The speedy Kevin Schade was established in the forward line; he joined Wissa and Mbeumo in scoring double figures last season. Jordan Henderson adds top-level experience in midfield where stats show Yehor Yarmolyuk, 21, as one of the leading pressers in the Premier League. The Ukrainian can pick a pass, too. Mikkel Damsgaard’s stuttering gait belies serious creativity and Michael Kayode is a marauding full-back who launches the long throws that are key part of the weaponry. Caoimhín Kelleher, who made a penalty save from United’s Bruno Fernandes, is enjoying being a No 1 goalkeeper and Dango Ouattara, Mbeumo’s replacement on the right, scored the goal against Aston Villa in August that secured Andrews’s first home win. Under Andrews, Brentford remain all-action, flinty, awkward to play against. Though a little more guarded publicly than his predecessor, Andrews – a former radio host on Ireland’s Newstalk station who also had a longstanding role as one of Sky’s EFL analysts – plays the media game well. After his team snatched a draw from Chelsea following a Schade long throw that sparked havoc, he considered the set-piece specialism, and the “carnage” it creates, that is now part of most teams’ makeup. “I felt there’s a little bit of snobbery in the game around scenarios like that, but if the big boys do it then it seems to be accepted,” Andrews said. The head coach has sought to refresh the group by inviting two Irish sporting heroes, the rugby union player Johnny Sexton and the Ryder Cup-winning captain Paul McGinley, to speak to his players. Not everyone from back home is willing on Ireland’s first Premier League manager since Chris Hughton, however. Andrews criticised the national team regime of Martin O’Neill and Roy Keane during his media career. O’Neill has been scathing; Keane a little more conciliatory towards someone he gave the full treatment in 2020. “I’ve heard a lot of bullshitters over the last 10 years and Keith Andrews is up there with the best of them,” were Keane’s words. Andrews taking on the Brentford challenge is the truest test of that and the strength of his club’s structures."
Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden left out of England squad but Saka returns,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/03/england-squad-thomas-tuchel-jude-bellingham-phil-foden-left-out-bukayo-saka-returns,"Thomas Tuchel has kept faith with the England squad that beat Andorra and excelled in Serbia last month and found no place for Jude Bellingham or Phil Foden in his camp for the friendly at home to Wales and the World Cup qualifier in Latvia. Foden was pushing for a recall after rediscovering his form at Manchester City and Bellingham has returned for Real Madrid after shoulder surgery, but the head coach has decided not to pick two of the country’s biggest attacking talents. Bellingham has started only once for his club. Tuchel has found space for Bukayo Saka, who is back to fitness and has been restored in place of his injured Arsenal teammate Noni Madueke. Jack Grealish has not been handed a recall. Tuchel loved the energy in last month’s squad and appears to want to maintain the vibe. Tino Livramento, who started at left-back in the 5-0 win in Belgrade, has dropped out with a knee injury. Tuchel has not called up a direct replacement for the Newcastle player but has picked John Stones, who had to pull out last month. Tuchel has talked about the Manchester City defender’s importance for England and has suggested using him in midfield. There is no place for Adam Wharton, who was called up last month but withdrew injured and was replaced by Ruben Loftus-Cheek. Tuchel said “team spirit is the key factor in the end” as he explained his decision to stick with last month’s squad, which he believes was the best of his reign for togetherness and teamwork. He said there was no problem in his relationship with Bellingham, Foden or Grealish and that Bellingham had made clear, during a “straightforward” phone call, his desire to be called up. “He’s a very special player and for special players there can always be special rules but for this camp we decided to stick with our straightforward decision to invite the same team,” Tuchel said. “He deserves always to be in camp. I think there is on top of it the situation that he has not gathered full rhythm yet. He is back in the team but he hasn’t finished one full match.” Tuchel said England were stronger with Bellingham, whom he described as one of the best players in the world, and that Foden, Grealish and Wharton were also worthy of places but said: “This is more about last camp and what we started to build.” He was clear there was a way back in for them all via club performances but that no one would be picked on reputation. Myles Lewis-Skelly was, Tuchel said, the biggest beneficiary of his selection, the Arsenal full-back having not started a Premier League game this season. A similar picture could lead to his omission for November’s camp, he said. “To just be a good citizen in camp will not be enough to stay the whole year,” the German said, adding that Lewis-Skelly would “have to perform at club level on a regular basis”."
"For Mauricio Pochettino, there is a power in ignorance for USMNT players",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/03/for-mauricio-pochettino-there-is-a-power-in-ignorance-for-usmnt-players,"The thing to know about Mauricio Pochettino is that, in his view, there is knowledge in not knowing. In a meditation on his unifying theory on the nature of knowledge that called to mind Donald Rumsfeld’s famous “unknown unknowns” diatribe, the Argentinian explained on Thursday why he never tells potential United States men’s national team players why they weren’t called up. “In our philosophy, players don’t need to know,” Pochettino said, launching into a six-minute monologue. “If a player needs to know, it’s because they don’t really feel the sport in the way that I feel it. Because you really know when you play why you play; and when you don’t play, you also deep down know why. The rest is …” and here he waffled, saying he preferred not to use a term he used last window (“bullshit”), while also offering no alternative. “The player wants you to justify; they want to know the evidence,” he continued. “If you explain, you are going to make the player happy. The players, they need to know. The players that were not called today, they need to be desperate to perform better [for] their clubs.” Pochettino spoke on the occasion of his calling up 26 players for friendlies with Ecuador on 10 October in Austin, Texas, and Australia on 14 October in Commerce City, Colorado. Which is to say that the 33 players who were previously called up in the former Tottenham, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain manager’s year in charge of the USMNT weren’t this time around, and won’t know why (with the exception of those that are injured and Tyler Adams, who will miss this window due to the upcoming birth of his second child). There are notable returns: Weston McKennie, Cameron Carter-Vickers, Mark McKenzie, Miles Robinson, Aidan Morris, Tanner Tessmann and Haji Wright were all brought back for another look. James Sands will return to the US camp for the first time under Pochettino. Left out were Yunus Musah, Josh Sargent, and Joe Scally, all of whom have been playing well for their clubs. Some players will have been left out strategically; some are just out of the picture. Which is which, nobody knows but for one man and his staff. To everyone else, it’s unknowable. But the players, at least … maybe they should know. In September, in the previous episode of the team’s angst-ridden road to the 2026 World Cup, the Americans slogged to a mirthless and panicky 2-0 loss to South Korea in New Jersey. But they followed this malperformance up with a spirited 2-0 win over Japan in Columbus, when a 3-4-2-1 system yielded ample scoring chances and some momentum and optimism at last. Fans and observers alike had hoped that this camp, with just two more full international windows to follow in November and March before the US assembles for the World Cup, would offer more definitive insight into Pochettino’s thinking for his first-choice squad. But Pochettino continues to use his roster selections to send messages, as he has since the two-loss debacle at the Concacaf Nations League in March – the last time several erstwhile regulars, like McKennie, were seen in a US jersey. “It’s not because your name is one [thing] or another, you’re going to have a place for sure on the roster for the World Cup,” said Pochettino on Thursday. “That’s an idea that we were fighting in the last year to try to fix. To change the culture. To change the idea of, ‘OK, because in the past I perform in some way, or because I did well four years ago, now I am ready to come and to use my place because that is my place.’ I think that has changed a lot. “It’s an open system,” Pochettino added. “They need to convince us to come again. They need to come here and to perform, to follow the rules, to behave in the way that we want [them to] behave, and try not only to win the games but to think and to build something important.” Pochettino has also been pragmatic in his roster choices, deliberate in which players to pluck from their club environments and when. He has carefully managed the travel and minutes expected from players who have recently had major injuries, or high workloads, sometimes leaving players like Sergiño Dest and Antonee Robinson with their clubs in deference to their long-term fitness in a World Cup year. Robinson, who has played just 64 Premier League minutes for Fulham since returning from knee surgery, is in camp this time around, but likely won’t play anywhere close to 180 minutes. “It’s important that he can be with us, his teammates,” Pochettino said. “It’s not only about tactics; it’s about giving some benefits to our players. The challenge is to help him start to feel the confidence again.” In that same vein, Pochettino has let players who were settling in with new clubs stay there during the September window before calling them again. Forward Patrick Agyemang, midfielder Malik Tillman and goalkeeper Matt Turner have all returned to camp after remaining with their clubs last month in the wake of transfers. Pochettino has suggested that he may call in fewer Major League Soccer players in November – there were 11 in camp in September, and 10 this time around – as their clubs will either be in the middle of playoff runs or already in their off season. In a sense, he’s behaving like a club manager – which he was all his coaching career after all, until taking the US job. Or at the very least, he’s operating in a way a club manager might appreciate. There is often tension between club and international coaches over players who aren’t entirely fit. Barcelona manager Hansi Flick was understandably upset when his teenage prodigy Lamine Yamal was reportedly called up to Spain in spite of an injury, injected with a painkiller and reportedly made to play against his wishes, only to return to the club with the injury aggravated. Then again, he’s also behaving like an international manager with the luxury of considering something beyond the short term. The US, after all, qualified for the World Cup automatically. And in his efforts to build depth and consider the players’ workload over an 18-month period – from his appointment through the World Cup – Pochettino has had the freedom, and relative absence of pressure, to worry about more than merely winning the next match. At times it’s paid off. Pochettino let Christian Pulisic sit out the summer (though not without some controversy), and the player has gotten off to a blazing start to the Serie A season. He is now the league’s leading scorer, helping Milan to first place through five rounds. “I think we can say that he is the most important player now for the national team,” Pochettino said of Pulisic on Thursday. Correlation might not be causation here, but chances are the time off helped refresh him and may well pay dividends for the US next summer. This is a calculation that Pochettino has made, that it’s better to manage his players than to assemble the full A-team at all times, no matter the issues that may ensue downstream. “We are preparing the World Cup,” Pochettino said. “We are not only preparing these two games.” Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out in the spring of 2026. You can preorder it here. He teaches at Marist University."
"Bournemouth’s Adrien Truffert: ‘It is important to do something outside of football, change your mindset’",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/03/bournemouths-adrien-truffert-it-is-important-to-do-something-outside-of-football-change-your-mindset,"Adrien Truffert has form for hitting the ground running. At Rennes, the club he joined at 13 and spent a decade at until leaving for Bournemouth in the summer, his debut arrived as a substitute against Monaco and culminated in him teeing up the equaliser with a wicked left-foot cross and then scoring a stoppage-time winner. Aged 18, Truffert sent a shot underneath Benjamin Lecomte, the opposition goalkeeper who visits Bournemouth with Fulham on Friday. “I ran off celebrating and slid on my knees,” Truffert says, “like you dream of doing as a kid after scoring your first goal.” Truffert has excelled for Bournemouth from the moment he contained Mohamed Salah on his first outing in a fearless team performance at Liverpool – where he also outshone his predecessor at left-back Milos Kerkez – and has played every minute in the Premier League this season. “We know we lost, so it cannot be perfect, but I think we played very well,” he says of Bournemouth’s trip to Anfield and their sole defeat in the competition this campaign. “I was very excited because it was my first game and it was a very good night. We have made a good start, but now we need to continue and win this week.” Listening to Truffert discuss his £11m move to the south coast, the first transfer of his career, it is little surprise he has slotted in so seamlessly. Staff talk of an intelligent individual and he is evidently switched on. He recognised the benefits of signing in June, to bed in during pre-season, and has spent the past two years having English lessons, aware how valuable they would prove if he achieved his ambition of reaching the Premier League. “That’s why I can speak a little English,” says the 23-year-old, a modest line given this first major interview is entirely in the language. “I think it is important to do something outside of football, to change your mindset and think about other things.” Put to Truffert that this speaks volumes of his character, he seeks no acclaim. “Maybe, but it was my parents who told me it was important.” Truffert’s family, including his younger brother Florian, a midfielder at Rennes, were part of his entourage when he signed, and maybe it was meant to be. Not because Bournemouth had landed a longstanding target but because Truffert spent time in the town as a toddler. He was born in Liège, Belgium, but when he was six months old his parents, Jean-Christophe and Laurence, moved to Southampton owing to his father’s work as a laboratory director. They spent two years living in the area. “My dad says that I took my first steps on Bournemouth beach,” Truffert says. “After those two years we returned to Belgium for six months and then moved to France.” Truffert has been capped once by Didier Deschamps’s side, in 2022, and last year he was part of the France side that won silver at the Olympics, the medal earning him a French knighthood. “I have the papers to show I have Chevalier d’honneur,” he says, exhibiting a proud smile. His teammates in Paris included Michael Olise, Maghnes Akliouche, Rayan Cherki, Jean-Philippe Mateta and Désiré Doué, with whom he also played at Rennes. His manager also happened to be his idol. “Thierry Henry, one of the best French players,” Truffert says. “When I was younger I played as a left and sometimes right winger, so that’s why I looked up to him. When I was about 17 or 18 I became a full-back. At the Olympics I played more as a defender, so Gaël Clichy [the assistant] mainly spoke to me, but when it was a team discussion he [Henry] taught me a lot of good things. His football brain was amazing, you could feel his experience and he wanted to pass it on to us.” Truffert was identified as an ideal fit for Andoni Iraola, whose approach is underpinned by intensity. “When you apply much more intensity than your opponent, I think it’s the best way to win,” Truffert says. “You have to do other things, of course, but if you start by winning more duels than your opponent, you have a much better chance to win. We run a lot because everybody wants to attack, but everybody also wants to defend. “For us it’s not only defenders who defend and attackers who attack. It’s everybody together. We like to do everything together on the pitch – and that’s the best way to win.” Truffert was captain at Rennes last season and at Bournemouth he leads by example; he trains how he plays and is regarded as a manager’s dream. He is also vastly experienced for his age with more than 200 career appearances and has played in the Champions League, Europa League and Conference League. In 2022-23, his Rennes side did the double over a Paris Saint-Germain side featuring Kylian Mbappé and Lionel Messi. The English top flight, he says, was the next logical step. Truffert sounded out friends and former teammates, including Jérémy Doku. “I think he’s one of the best 1v1 players I’ve seen. Mbappé was also tough to play against and you learn a lot against these kinds of players because they can flip a game,” Truffert says. “Now at Man City, Jérémy plays more on the left, but when he was at Rennes he played more on the right so I had to face him a lot in training. “It was good for me to level up. He told me the intensity is very different to Ligue 1. In France, it is maybe a bit more tactical – here every game you have to run a lot, no rest.” The downtime Truffert has had since swapping a Bournemouth hotel for a house in Poole last month has allowed him to explore the area with his wife, Floriane, and their chow chow, Blue, named after the colour of its tongue. “We like to walk around the town or by the sea; there is a very nice park in Parkstone,” Truffert says. Being joined by a contingent of French-speaking players in Amine Adli, Eli Kroupi and Bafodé Diakité this summer helped him settle. “There is everything to be happy.” According to the analytics company Gradient Sports, Truffert ranks second for total distances covered and high-speed running distances this season among full-backs and wing-backs and, overall, he is the league’s third-most athletic player, behind only Daniel Muñoz and Jackson Tchatchoua. Only Pedro Porro and Hugo Bueno have completed more crosses into the opposition box. “It’s been a good start, but I’m sure I can and will do better,” Truffert says. “I’m here to show my quality.”"
Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/03/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend,"Senesi and stability boost Bournemouth Unbeaten in the league since their Friday night opener at Anfield, Bournemouth’s early momentum has been stalled by consecutive draws: at home to Newcastle and at Leeds last week. Fulham visit the Vitality Stadium on Friday, offering Andoni Iraola’s side a presentable chance of recapturing winning ways and going second in the table. After a turbulent summer, Iraola has sought consistency in his team selection. Trailing 2-1 at Leeds, the Bournemouth manager made a triple change to restore three usual starters – David Brooks, Alex Scott and Marcus Tavernier – to his XI and was rewarded with a late leveller. Bournemouth have also maintained defensive stability, conceding just once in four games between the trips to Liverpool and Leeds. Marcos Senesi, often playing in an otherwise brand-new back five, has been key to the team’s continuity. The centre-back earned praise from Iraola for his defensive work and threat at attacking set pieces – as evidenced by his headed assist for Eli Junior Kroupi’s equaliser at Elland Road. Niall McVeigh Bournemouth v Fulham, Friday 8pm (all times BST) Longstaff key to Leeds’ set-piece threat If Leeds are to survive and maybe even thrive this season they will need to continue taking mean dead balls. Three of the six league goals Daniel Farke’s side have scored since returning to the top tier have derived from set pieces and they could do with further examples – or at least an example – arriving at Tottenham’s expense at Elland Road on Saturday. Farke has deployed Sean Longstaff as his principal corner taker and, so far, the former Newcastle midfielder is proving highly adept and, crucially, consistent at the art. This reassignment of on-field duties has also liberated his fellow midfielder Anton Stach to get into the penalty area at set plays and hurl his towering frame at the ball. Back on Tyneside, Longstaff also possessed a knack for making late, almost Frank Lampardesque dashes into the box and scored a few goals from open play. Now Farke could do with rekindling that instinct in a player who lost his way a little at St James’ Park last season but is looking encouragingly renascent. Louise Taylor Leeds v Tottenham, Saturday 12.30pm Black Cats could spell trouble for Amorim With a trip to Anfield looming after the international break, a home game against promoted opponents is, in theory, an opportunity for Ruben Amorim to lift the suffocating gloom around Manchester United. In reality, it could be another very difficult afternoon at Old Trafford against an impressive Sunderland side with two core attributes their hosts are sorely lacking: identity and adaptability. Asked how he has been able to build such a cohesive unit from a long list of summer signings, Régis Le Bris, the Sunderland manager, said: “The new lads bring a new energy and style of play … [but] we don’t start from scratch – the identity of the club is already there.” While Amorim remains mired in his own stubborn inflexibility, Le Bris has shown he is willing to adapt. Heading into last season’s Championship playoffs on the back of five straight defeats, he switched to a more reactive style and built the foundation for success in the Premier League. All of this has been achieved while Amorim has essentially taken his United team nowhere, and few would be truly shocked if Sunderland were to push him closer to the exit door this weekend. NMc Manchester United v Sunderland, Saturday 3pm Arsenal can move on from Hammers defeats After ending their hoodoos away at Newcastle and at home to Olympiakos in the last two games, next up for Arsenal is a chance to banish memories of two successive defeats by West Ham at the Emirates Stadium. Both ended up damaging their hopes of winning the Premier League, with the 1-0 reverse in February one of the few occasions when Graham Potter had something to celebrate during his ill-fated spell in charge of the Hammers. A promising draw in his first match against Everton will have helped Nuno Espírito Santo settle into his new surroundings and the former Nottingham Forest manager will be keen to build on that on Saturday, having not tasted success against Arsenal since he was in charge of Wolves in 2021. Ed Aarons Arsenal v West Ham, Saturday 3pm Maresca may look to Lavia against Liverpool Roméo Lavia was excellent when Chelsea beat Liverpool at Stamford Bridge in May. The Belgium midfielder offers elegance on the ball and a fine ability to beat the press. But while he often makes Enzo Maresca’s system look smoother, Lavia’s fitness record remains a problem. The former Southampton midfielder was injured when Chelsea beat Benfica in the last 16 of the Club World Cup in June and has only just returned. Ideally Maresca would be able to ease Lavia back in and give him time to build his fitness. Chelsea, though, are struggling with injuries. Andrey Santos and Dário Essugo will be missing when Maresca’s side host Liverpool on Saturday, heaping the pressure on Enzo Fernández and Moisés Caicedo in midfield. Options to rotate are slim. Caicedo and Fernández could do with a rest but are both playing through niggles. It is probably too soon for Lavia to start – he has made only one brief substitute appearance this season – but he will be a useful option on the bench. Jacob Steinberg Chelsea v Liverpool, Saturday 5.30pm Lack of in-form forwards a problem for Moyes David Moyes was particularly touchy on the subject of his struggling strikers when the trials of Beto and Thierno Barry cropped up before West Ham’s visit. “I’m not daft enough to think everything is going to be hunky dory,” he said. “We are still rebuilding.” That is true, but his mood will not have improved after another anonymous showing from the pair in Monday’s disappointing draw. There are echoes of Moyes’s first spell in charge of Everton, with a good unit lacking the high-calibre striker necessary to make a difference. Creativity is not a problem for a team with Jack Grealish, Iliman Ndiaye and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall but, aside from a crucial purple patch of five goals in four league games in February, Beto has not convinced. His recent body language has not impressed either. Everton felt Barry was one for the future when paying £27m for the 22-year-old this summer but would have expected more from a forward who is yet to open his account. In-form Crystal Palace, having set a club record of 19 matches unbeaten in all competitions, can prey on Everton’s glaring weakness. Andy Hunter Everton v Crystal Palace, Sunday 2pm Questions loom over Postecoglou and Howe Is it too early for a relegation six-pointer? Are these teams really capable of juggling their domestic and European commitments? Tactically speaking, is Ange Postecoglou going about silencing his critics in the right way? Will Forest’s Chris Wood score against his old club? Or will Eddie Howe’s star signing, Nick Woltemade, win the battle of the centre-forwards? Could this be the match where Newcastle’s £55m summer signing from Forest, Anthony Elanga, really comes alive down the right wing? There are so many unanswered questions and the responses will determine whether Howe or Postecoglou will need to brace themselves for “crisis” headlines. Both managers, like their teams, desperately need a restorative win. LT Newcastle v Nottingham Forest, Sunday 2pm Pereira needs Wolves’ recruits to show worth “You sold the team, now sell the club.” Wolves fans could not have been clearer about their feelings during the recent defeat by promoted Leeds at Molineux. There are a couple of things for Vítor Pereira to cling to, though, despite the obvious weakening of his squad by high-profile summer departures: a point at Tottenham that could so easily have been three and the Carabao Cup win over Everton that was a step towards placating growing anger in the stands. Despite João Palhinha’s stoppage-time equaliser in north London, Pereira pointed to the spirit of his players, and his old-school methods, including bonding trips to the boozer, appear to be keeping the dressing-room mood upbeat. Pereira’s preferred tipple is Stella Artois but, with a relegation scrap looming, it remains to be seen whether any of his summer reinforcements prove to be reassuringly expensive. Luke McLaughlin Wolves v Brighton, Sunday 2pm Emery has Villa pointing in right direction If succeeding Arsène Wenger was an impossible job for Unai Emery at Arsenal, stepping into Steven Gerrard’s shoes at Villa Park was considerably easier. “I’m not here to waste my time” – Emery’s internal mission statement on arrival in 2022 – was one of the more memorable lines from a Premier League manager in recent times. Villa’s improvement since is attributable to appointing a smart tactician and capable motivator whose managerial career path has been an unusual mix. A flat start this season has been the first significant bump in the road during his Villa tenure and the mood has been downbeat; still, Emery’s side were undefeated in 90 minutes across five matches in September, finishing with wins against Bologna and Fulham. Form is a funny thing – just ask Morgan Rogers. But after another encouraging win, at Feyenoord, Emery’s solid methods and self-belief are likely to steer Villa through a challenging time. LMc Aston Villa v Burnley, Sunday 2pm Foden can ease burden on Haaland After six league games Manchester City’s second-highest scorer is Maxime Estevé, the unfortunate Burnley centre-back who notched two own goals at the Etihad Stadium last Saturday. It’s not a huge problem with Erling Haaland in such ruthless form, having scored 11 goals in all competitions and eight in the league, double any other player’s tally and more than 11 of the 19 other top-flight teams. There was, though, a hint of frustration in Haaland’s post-match interview after defensive lapses cancelled out his two goals in Monaco. “Not good enough,” was his concise verdict on City’s overall display, and Brentford’s set-piece muscle will surely test the visitors’ soft centre again on Sunday. If City cannot keep clean sheets, Haaland will need more help from his attacking teammates. Phil Foden certainly has form at the Gtech, having scored every one of City’s six goals at the venue since 2021. If Foden can add firepower to his improved form, Pep Guardiola’s side might begin to look truly formidable again. NMc Brentford v Manchester City, Sunday 4.30pm"
Nuno Espírito Santo says creating identity at West Ham is his ‘priority’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/02/nuno-espirito-santo-new-manager-west-ham-united-premier-league,"Nuno Espírito Santo believes it will take time for him to build an identity and philosophy at West Ham. The former Nottingham Forest manager is adjusting to his latest role after a whirlwind start and is looking to connect with his new club’s culture on an emotional level. Nuno, who was appointed following the brutal sacking of Graham Potter last weekend, said that longstanding members of staff have spent the week filling him in on life at West Ham. He smiled when asked for his interpretation of the West Ham way, a concept that means “gung-ho football” to some fans but passion and resilience to others. “That’s what I’m trying to understand every day,” he said. “Every day they tell me this. It’s not about understanding. It goes much further. We have to feel it. I need some time to feel it. I’m starting to understand it, but I really have to feel it. And after we really feel it we have to put it inside of us. “You have to put it inside of you. What makes the difference is the feeling, not only the understanding. If you feel, it goes much further. You’re talking about the philosophy and identity. How far are we from that? It’s not enough to say a ‘West Ham way’. Let’s build it, let’s create it, let’s feel it. Let’s identify ourselves with that.” Nuno, who began his tenure with an encouraging 1-1 draw at Everton on Monday, was asked how far he is from developing an identity. “I think very far,” he said. “It’s so hard to do it. It requires so much effort from everybody at the club. But it’s a priority.” There is often a demand from the fanbase for an exciting brand of football. David Moyes, the most successful West Ham manager of the modern era, eventually came under pressure because of his pragmatic approach. But Julen Lopetegui and Potter struggled to change the style of play in the post-Moyes era. It falls to Nuno, who played a counterattacking style at Forest, to decide whether results are more important than entertainment. West Ham have conceded 14 goals in their first six league games and are languishing in 19th place. “What determines the style of play is not the coach,” Nuno said. “What determines the style of play is the squad. It’s not the coach. “We have to find the balance between the two parts of the game. The defensive part and the offensive part. We cannot attack with an unbalanced way because we open spaces for our opponents. We have to defend, organise, but always with a priority. When we recover, what are we going to do with the ball?” West Ham could welcome back Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Jean-Clair Todibo when they visit Arsenal on Saturday. Nuno also left the door open for a recall for James Ward-Prowse, who was dropped from the squad against Everton. Ward-Prowse briefly played for Nuno at Forest last season but the midfielder was not a regular and his loan spell was cut short in February."
"Nottm Forest 2-3 Midtjylland, Feyenoord 0-2 Aston Villa: Europa League – as it happened",https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/oct/02/nottingham-forest-v-midtjylland-feyenoord-v-aston-villa-and-more-europa-league-live,"Here’s Ben Fisher’s verdict from the City Ground. Thanks for joining me, it’s been fun. Until next time … Here’s Ed Aarons’ report from Lublin on Palace’s earlier victory … And a roundup of the early Europa League action. Here’s Ange Postecoglou: “Really disappointing. Really, really poor – the goals we conceded … key moments let us down, we haven’t shown as much desire as the opposition. It’s been the story of the last few games.” Did refereeing decisions play a part? “We allowed them to play a part, it shouldn’t have come to that. We’re not winning games, which is what we need to do. “I heard [the chants at the end] – they’re fans, they want to see their team win. Does it surprise me? Nothing surprises me in football. We’ve just got to keep our heads up. I’ve not seen anything to suggest the players are not trying to take my ideas on board, but we’re not delivering in key moments.” Aberdeen 2-3 Shakhtar Donetsk AEK Larnaca 4-0 AZ Alkmaar Celje 3-1 AEK Athens Fiorentina 2-0 Sigma Olomouc Legia Warsaw 0-1 Samsunspor Rakow 2-0 Univ. Craiova Shelbourne 0-0 Häcken Slovan Bratislava 1-2 Strasbourg Sparta Prague 4-1 Shamrock Rovers Basel 2-0 Stuttgart Celta Vigo 3-1 PAOK Porto 2-1 Red Star Feyenoord 0-2 Aston Villa Genk 0-1 Ferencvaros Lyon 2-0 Salzburg Maccabi Tel Aviv 1-3 Dinamo Zagreb Nottingham Forest 2-3 Midtjylland Sturm Graz 2-1 Rangers Forest have time to swing in a couple of dangerous crosses, but the visitors see it out for an impressive win. At full-time the boos ring out, following chants of “sacked in the morning” after Midtjylland’s winner. Six games without a win as Forest manager now for Big Ange. A job well done for Unai Emery’s side, who withstood first-half pressure before grabbing all three points with goals from Emi Buendía and John McGinn. Aberdeen scored the first and last goals of the game but were undone by three Shakhtar goals in a 20-minute spell either side of half-time. The positives: Rangers won the second half, after a dismal first 45 minutes. The negatives: they still lost the game. Chris Wood slots home the penalty, and there’s still three minutes for the hosts to rescue something – despite plenty of home fans heading for the exits straight after Byskov struck. Penalty for Forest! Anderson gets a kick on the ankle and after being invited to look at the monitor, the referee points to the spot. A bad night gets even worse for Ange Postecoglou. Here, the visitors mix things up by scoring from a Forest corner, breaking downfield before Valdemar Byskov sweeps home. There was certainly a case that Hudson-Odoi was fouled in the buildup, but the referee waved play on. Basel double their lead at home to Stuttgart, Moritz Broschinski finishing off a cross from Xherdan Shaqiri. At least it’s a reasonably short trip home for the away fans. In the Conference League, Slovenian upstarts Celje – who reached the quarter-finals last season – are 3-1 up at home to AEK Athens. It’s looking like a very happy return to Rotterdam for Villa. Donyell Malen bustles through on goal and while the keeper closes down his shot, it rebounds nicely for John McGinn to fire home. And again! Chris Wood sees a second goal disallowed after racing through and prodding into the far corner – but he’s a couple of yards offside. Forest have the ball in the net, but Elliot Anderson was offside when he pounced on a rebound from Neco Williams’ shot and crossed for Wood to tap home. Still, Forest have the momentum … Celta now lead PAOK 3-1, the excellently-named Williot Swedberg extending their lead. In the Conference League, AZ Alkmaar are 3-0 down at AEK Larnaca, having been down to 10 men since the second minute. Buendía and Watkins head off in Rotterdam, replaced by Donyell Malen and young defender Lamarae Bogarde. A big change for Forest: Igor Jesus is going off, with Chris Wood coming on. I suppose one upside of Aston Villa’s PSR concerns this summer is that they’ve been forced to use Emi Buendía, a player they had left in a cupboard somewhere but who is now reminding Unai Emery he’s quite a decent footballer. Maybe Jimmy Thelin’s goose isn’t entirely cooked yet – Nicky Devlin has headed home to get Aberdeen back in the game. Forest have started to find some attacking rhythm, and overcome another nervous moment from a Midtjylland corner. They still trail though, with the clock ticking towards 70 minutes. In the Conference League, Shamrock Rovers are 3-0 down in an admittedly tough away day at Sparta Prague – but Shelbourne are holding Häcken at home, where it’s still goalless. Aberdeen now trail 3-1 to Shakhtar, Pedro Henrique extending the visitors’ lead. Elsewhere, Borja Iglesias has put my Europa League dark horses, Celta Vigo, 2-1 up against Greece’s PAOK. It had been coming since the restart and now Villa lead! It’s their comeback kid, Emi Buendía, who finishes clinically from the edge of the area after a scrappy passage of play. That came moments after a decent penalty shout was waved away. A big chance for Aston Villa, with Evann Guessand unable to turn home Ian Maatsen’s dangerous low cross from the left. At the City Ground, Forest just about deal with a string of Midtjylland corners before Igor Jesus heads wide at the other end. Shakhtar have turned it round to lead at Pittodrie, with Lucas Ferreira climbing to head home a cross at the far post. On the touchline, visiting manager Arda Turan looks very pleased with his side’s fightback. A lifeline for Rangers in Austria as Djeidi Gassama cuts inside two defenders and smashes home at the near post. The away fans – many of whom are holding banners with Russell Martin’s face crossed out – celebrate tentatively. “Why are there so many more British and Irish players playing in Europe these days?” asks John Brennan. “By my reckoning the following continental teams have someone in their squad tonight: Bologna, Fenerbahce, Roma, Ferencvaros, Lyon, Dinamo Zagreb &amp; Strasbourg. When did this start happening?” It’s what I’m minded to call the Jude Bellingham effect – as the Premier League’s financial domination has continued to grow, more players in the UK and Ireland can see a clearer path to first-team football – and possible international recognition – by moving overseas. It’s broadly a positive thing, I would venture. Conference League half-times: Aberdeen 1-1 Shakhtar Donetsk AEK Larnaca 1-0 AZ Alkmaar Celje 1-1 AEK Athens Fiorentina 1-0 Sigma Olomouc Legia Warsaw 0-1 Samsunspor Rakow 0-0 Univ. Craiova Shelbourne 0-0 Häcken Slovan Bratislava 0-2 Strasbourg Sparta Prague 2-0 Shamrock Rovers All square at the break, Jesper Karlsson’s early penalty cancelled out by Yehor Nazaryna near the end of the first half. Europa League half-times: Basel 1-0 Stuttgart Celta Vigo 1-1 PAOK Porto 1-1 Red Star Feyenoord 0-0 Aston Villa Genk 0-1 Ferencvaros Lyon 1-0 Salzburg Maccabi Tel Aviv 1-2 Dinamo Zagreb Nottingham Forest 1-2 Midtjylland Sturm Graz 2-0 Rangers Compared to messrs Martin and Postecoglou, Unai Emery is on easy street – but that could all change if Villa concede. Robin van Persie’s Feyenoord could have been down to 10 men, but have grown into the game. Ah look mate, it’s not going well is it? There are scattered boos around the City Ground as Forest go in behind, with Midtjylland scoring twice from set pieces and looking the better side as the half progressed. “So far, Rangers have not done a great job weathering the Sturm,” notes Peter Oh. Russell Martin’s side trail 2-0 in Graz. Will their much-maligned manager be put out to pasture? There are brief but audible cries of “you don’t know what you’re doing” from the Forest fans as the hosts struggle to regain a foothold. Hudson-Odoi’s hopeful shot is blocked by Diao as we enter three minutes of stoppage time. Shakhtar are level at Pittodrie, midfielder Yehor Nazaryna finishing nicely from Pedrinho da Silva’s cross. Shakhtar have two players called Pedrinho in their team tonight, by the way. Rangers go two down and it’s an utterly rubbish goal to concede. From a free kick, a low pass forward exposes a needlessly high line, allowint Kiteishvili to stroll through and lift the ball over Butland. Apparently the VAR screens aren’t working properly at the City Ground tonight. Another element to throw into a combustible mix, with Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis currently huffing and puffing in the stands. If only he could find a manager capable of organising a defence, eh? Watkins also saw a shot cleared off the line while at the other end, Bizot has made saves to deny Hadj Moussa and Ueda in quick succession. Over in Austria, Butland has been called into action to keep Rangers in touch – Sturm Graz still lead 1-0. With all this chaos at the City Ground, I’ve barely had time to report on Villa’s progress. Feyenoord’s Anel Ahmedhodzic was booked for a last-man foul on Ollie Watkins, with the referee reviewing but sticking with his decision after a word in the ear from VAR. Forest are back behind almost immediately, and it’s another set-piece nightmare. Sorensen, who set up the opener from a free kick, stabs home a loose ball from a corner. Murillo is injured in the melee, and will have to go off. I wonder if Nuno’s watching. A welcome quick leveller to quiet any murmurs of discontent at the City Ground. Dan Ndoye sweeps home to finish off a nice team move, and we’re all square. Or are we? There was a late change to the Aston Villa line-up, with Marco Bizot replacing Emi Martínez in goal. No official word on why that is, although Tony Hughes has had enough: “That’s two European games running he’s missed. He and Villa should part ways in January.” It’s another goal conceded from a set piece as Forest fail to deal with a free kick, flicked on by Sorensen and smashed in at the far post by fellow centre-back Ousmane Diao. It’s been a spicy start to Forest v Midtjylland, with some hefty challenges flying in already. The visitors are second in the Danish league and recently won 3-1 at Brondby – who are managed by none other than Steve Cooper. Porto lead Red Star Belgrade through William Gomes’ penalty, while Lyon lead Salzburg 1-0 through Martin Satriano’s header after Pavel Sulc missed an early spot-kick for the hosts. Better news for another struggling Scottish side, though, with Jesper Karlsson firing home an early penalty at Pittodrie. It could have been even better for the hosts, with Leighton Clarkson failing to punish an awful error from the Shakhtar keeper. A nightmare start for Russell Martin as the hosts take an early lead. It’s all too easy, a diagonal pass causing defensive chaos before Tomi Horvat’s shot deflects in off Jack Butland’s knee. Speaking of early aberrations, AZ Alkmaar’s Penetra has been sent off after just two minutes at AEK Larnaca in the Conference League. We got our first red card before a first goal – that came three minutes in at Basel, who lead Stuttgart through Albian Ajeti. We’re under way in all of the 8pm kick-offs. At the City Ground, Postecoglou has gone for a back three of Milenkovic, Murillo and Morato – but the latter picks up an immediate booking and Midtjylland have a dangerous free kick, which deflects wide. Dynamo Kyiv 0-2 Crystal Palace Jagellonia 1-0 Hamrun KuPS 1-1 Drita Lausanne 3-0 Breidablik Lech Poznan 4-1 Rapid Vienna Noah 1-0 Rijeka Omonia Nicosia 0-1 Mainz Rayo Vallecano 2-0 Shkendija Zrinjski 5-0 Lincoln Red Imps Roma 0-1 Lille Bologna 1-1 Freiburg Brann 1-0 Utrecht Celtic 0-2 Braga FCSB 0-2 Young Boys Fenerbahce 2-1 Nice Ludogorets 0-2 Betis Panathinaikos 1-2 Go Ahead Eagles Viktoria Plzen 3-0 Malmö Ange Postecoglou: “It’s an exciting night, the club has a rich European history and it’s an overdue return. We’re gonna need some energy tonight … they’ve got a big focus on set plays, they’re very direct. We’ve done our work to make sure we’re ready. But ultimately we’re at home, and we should be able to put the pressure on them.” Rangers’ Russell Martin: “We have to run together, work together, fight to the end. [Sturm Graz] are very good at what they do, so we have to try and utilise our strengths and hurt them if we can, by playing the way we want to.” Unai Emery: “We are in a process but I am seeing an improvement, in how we are playing as a team, introducing the new players. The Premier League is such a demanding league, we have to be so focused and consistent. Europe is always very difficult and we have our own experience with this. It’s a very good test for us today.” Tonight’s later Conference League games feature two League of Ireland teams: “Shelbourne and Shamrock Rovers are the first pair of Irish teams to reach the group stage of the same competition,” writes John Brennan. Shelbourne (who host Häcken) beat Linfield to reach the league phase, while Shamrock Rovers will be looking to do better than last year when they qualified for the knockout rounds before eventually losing to Molde on penalties. They beat Santa Clara of Portugal to get here, and face Sparta Prague last night. Former Ireland U21 international Pico Lopes starts in defence – he could feature at the World Cup next summer with Cape Verde.” More Euro woe for Celtic, beaten at home by Braga, who top the (very early) Europa League table with two wins. Brendan Rodgers can point to VAR’s decision to disallow Kelechi Iheanacho’s equaliser for a handball nobody else could see, but it’s still another disappointing night for his team. Palace begin their Conference League group-stage campaign with a deserved win, Daniel Muñoz and Eddie Nketiah the scorers. Borna Sosa’s late red card was the only blemish on an otherwise excellent night for Oliver Glasner’s army. Shout out to Lille keeper Berke Ozer, who has saved three Roma penalty attempts to preserve his team’s lead. Ozer saved Matias Soulé’s spot-kick after his two previous saves – both from Artem Dovbyk – were ruled out for encroachment. Hat-tip to Iain Kelly for pointing out there were three attempts, rather than two. There’s a bit more on Ozer here, although in the interests of balance I should point out that my list also included Borna Sosa. Oh dear. Celtic fans head for the exits en masse after Braga double their lead. Rodrigues’ shot was parried by Schmeichel and while Gabri Martínez’s first shot was blocked, an attempted clearance ricochets off his shins and into the net. Red card! Palace were cruising, but Borna Sosa has been sent off after a second yellow card, for what was a pretty careless challenge. There’s just under 15 minutes for Dynamo Kyiv to get back into the game … Nottingham Forest (3-4-3): Sels; Milenkovic, Morato, Murillo; Ndoye, Anderson, Sangaré, Williams; Gibbs-White, Igor Jesus, Hudson-Odoi.

Moments later, Nketiah does get his goal, finishing well after Yeremy Piño’s lovely turn and cross into the area. It’s no more than Palace deserve. Another disallowed goal, more clear-cut this time as substitute Eddie Nketiah’s effort for Crystal Palace is chalked off for an offside … Celtic thought they were level, but Kelechi Iheanacho’s strike has been disallowed by VAR, who ruled that the forward controlled the ball with his arm in the buildup. From the angle we’ve seen, it wasn’t clear the ball touched his arm at all.

Another tough European night for Brendan Rodgers so far, as the visitors lead through Ricardo Horta’s long-range shot, which had Kasper Schmeichel flapping at thin air. Nottingham Forest’s last home game in Europe was a sobering affair: hopeful after returning from Munich with just a 2-1 deficit, the hosts shipped five goals to a rampant Bayern side in March 1996. Tonight’s opponents, Midtjylland, did not even exist back then – the Danish side were formed by a merger in 1999 but have amassed extensive European experience in the last decade, and represent a tough test for Ange Postecoglou, still seeking his first win as Forest manager. Aston Villa have also made an underwhelming start to the season and face a more established European name in Feyenoord – whose home ground in Rotterdam was scene of Villa’s greatest night back in 1982. While fans enjoy a nostalgic trip to De Kuip, Unai Emery’s chief concern will be maintaining momentum after eking out successive victories over Bologna and Fulham in the last week. Speaking of tough starts, Russell Martin may have finally won a game and boosted his standing among Rangers fans by around 0.0001%, but Sturm Graz look capable of returning the beleaguered manager to rock bottom. Another manager under pressure, Aberdeen’s Jimmy Thelin, welcomes Shakhtar Donetsk to Pittodrie in the Conference League. All those games kick off at 8pm (BST), but we’ll have updates from Crystal Palace’s Conference League trip to face Dynamo Kyiv in Poland and Celtic’s home Europa League game against Braga, plus all the other hot Euro action. Hold tight!"
Nottingham Forest fans call for Postecoglou axe after 23 days following European defeat,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/02/nottingham-forest-midtjylland-europa-league-match-report,"Ange Postecoglou finds himself in an ominously tight spot after 23 days in the job. As Midtjylland streamed forward on the counterattack in the 88th minute, the Nottingham Forest manager rested his hands on his head, convinced how the next few seconds would play out. Forest, as he feared, would concede for a third time but, presumably, he did not anticipate the vociferous and vicious backlash that followed. The scenes were close to extraordinary on a sobering evening, thousands of home supporters singing: “You’re getting sacked in the morning.” Then the same fans twisted the knife a little deeper, singing the name of his predecessor Nuno Espírito Santo, with several turning towards Evangelos Marinakis, the owner watching on with his own giant private television in the directors’ box. This made for grim viewing. It is now six games without victory for Postecoglou, whose side travel to Newcastle on Sunday before hosting Chelsea two weeks on Saturday. Then it is Porto at home in this competition, Bournemouth away and Manchester United to kick-off November. After this defeat by Danish opposition, there are doubts about whether the Australian will make it that far. The inquest in the stands began at half-time, at which point Forest trailed to set-piece goals from Ousmane Diao and Mads Bech Sørensen, formerly of Brentford, and afterwards Postecoglou faced some tough questions. Asked if he still believed positive results are on the horizon, the 60-year-old replied: “Yes, I do, and nothing I saw tonight changes any of that. I get the mood around the place isn’t going to be great, I understand people’s attitude, particularly towards me, but I never worry about that, it’s not unfamiliar territory for me. I really believe that we’re on the right track and when we get through this period of uncertainty that we’ll be on a good path. If we start winning games, the atmosphere will improve.” A week on from the optimism that accompanied Forest’s trip to Seville, where they were held to a draw against Real Betis after squandering the lead late on, the mood has shifted significantly. “I guess it’s the accumulation of things,” Postecoglou said. “It’s not like our goalkeeper is having to make multiple saves, but every time they get near our goal they [the players] get really nervous. If you allow the opposition to score just about every time they get near your goal, it’s going to be very hard to win games.” Postecoglou is the first Forest manager for 100 years to fail to win any of his first six matches, though perhaps he will take encouragement that John Baynes, who did not win any of his first seven in 1925, ended up sticking around for four years. These are different days, though, as Postecoglou acknowledged. “Nothing surprises me in football, it’s the climate we’re in,” he said, when asked about the chants aimed at him. “It seems that’s the way things are going. It’s nothing I can control. The fans are disappointed, they are allowed to have an opinion on it. I heard their opinion.” Postecoglou insisted his players did their homework and knew to expect an awkward assignment but the visitors’ direct “vertical football” proved Forest’s undoing, Midtjylland twice scoring from set pieces before Valdemar Byskov Andreasen capped the scoring after Dario Osorio pinched possession from Callum Hudson-Odoi deep in the Danish side’s half. Chris Wood’s stoppage-time penalty after Elliot Anderson, Forest’s best player, was fouled proved merely a consolation. Postecoglou’s Tottenham were vulnerable from set pieces last season – only Arsenal, Southampton and Wolves conceded more from set plays in the Premier League – and it was a recurring problem here. Things got worse when Murillo, back in the starting lineup after injury, limped off before the half-hour mark. There was further alarm for Forest in the first half when Diao comfortably peeled off his man at another corner and directed a header wide of goal. Before kick-off at least, this was another moment to cherish for Forest, as they staged their first European home fixture since Bayern Munich’s 5-1 triumph here in March 1996. At which point Midtjylland had not even been formed, that coming three years later when Herning, the 55,000-population town in central Denmark where they play home games, and Ikast, where they now train, merged. Marinakis, the night after watching his first club, Olympiakos, fall to a Champions League defeat at the Emirates Stadium, sauntered on to the pitch before the warmups to survey the scene. Everything was in place for the occasion: the pyrotechnics as the players emerged, the Europa League-branded tunnel arch and a sellout crowd. The tifo in the Trent End was typically brilliant, an image of a Forest campervan with Postecoglou at the wheel and the words: “For a new generation our time has come”. Everything was primed for Postecoglou to register that elusive first win. Perhaps Forest were guilty of viewing this game as a gimme. Regardless, it was not supposed to be like this."
Chelsea juggernaut heads to Manchester United for trickiest WSL test so far,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/02/chelsea-juggernaut-heads-to-manchester-united-for-trickiest-wsl-test-so-far-womens-football,"It has been more than 500 days since Chelsea last lost a Women’s Super League game. That sentence alone tells you how exceptional they are, and whichever way you frame the statistics they are daunting. How about “Sonia Bompastor is yet to lose a WSL game after 15 months in charge”, “The Frenchwoman has won 23 of her 26 WSL games without defeat” or “Bompastor is unbeaten in 34 domestic matches since moving to England”? All are true, all sound formidable, and – after four wins from four this term – they are showing no signs of letting up. Who will bring this run to a halt? Eventually, Chelsea will lose a WSL match. It might not be this week, it might not be in 2025, it might not even be this season. Maybe it won’t even be during this parliament, but one day it will happen, and logic suggests that the fixtures where their streak has the highest probability of ending is in one of their away games against their main title rivals, Arsenal, Manchester City or Manchester United. On Friday, the latter of that trio will have their turn, and form-wise they have rarely been better placed to have a go at it. The top two teams in the early-season table go head to head in Leigh under the lights and, although the WSL season is only four rounds of fixtures old, Manchester United go into Friday’s fixture with the best defensive record in the league. History favours Chelsea though, because the most damning stat of all is perhaps this: Manchester United have never beaten Chelsea in the WSL. In fact they have managed only one draw from their 11 previous WSL meetings. Nevertheless, the home team’s manager, Marc Skinner, wants his team to believe. “It’s by far the most difficult challenge in the WSL right now, of course it is,” Skinner said. “We want to try to break that run when we play them on Friday but it’s difficult. “They’re such a well-oiled machine. They have incredible quality, depth and quality, that they’ve built over many seasons. I expect the toughest of challenges on Friday and we’ve got to be ready. “I really think you can hurt Chelsea with the ball, but you’ve got to be brave in doing that, because it’s higher risk because they’re really good in duels. You have to believe that you can beat them, you have to show Chelsea that you can beat them.” For Bompastor, who oversaw a domestic treble of major trophies last term in her first season in English football, the statistics mean very little. “This story about the unbeaten run is more for the journalists,” she said. “We started this season from zero, we won four games out of four, and we want to go into every game with the desire to win. We are early in the season, we did not achieve anything yet.” The former Lyon coach has fond memories of visiting Leigh, because it was where her team clinched last season’s title on 30 April, with a 1-0 win courtesy of a Lucy Bronze header. This time they face a Manchester United side who have conceded only one goal in four league games and Bompastor said: “United look strong and they’ve had a good start to the season. “In these games, it’s always tough. Maybe you create [fewer] chances than in some of the games and you need to make sure you are clinical and efficient. I think that’s what makes the difference in the highest-level games.” The joint-leading goalscorers in the WSL this term will be in action on either side: United’s Melvine Malard has four goals from four WSL games, as does Chelsea’s Aggie Beever-Jones, who has scored in every game. Bompastor said, of the England’s striker’s flourishing form: “From the beginning when I joined the club, I could recognise that Aggie was a really good player with a lot of talent, and also a really complete player. “Out of possession she is great; she is the first one in the frontline to apply the press. In possession, we have been working hard with her, trying for her to be as successful as she can be in many aspects of her game. Right now, she is really confident [and] that’s great for the team.” It is a cliche in football that the “first goal will be crucial” but it seems especially true here; Manchester United are unbeaten in each of the past 25 WSL games in which they have taken the lead. If they can finally end their wait for a first win against Chelsea, it would be the first major twist in the WSL title race."
Crystal Palace extend unbeaten run as Muñoz gets European tilt off to flying start,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/02/dynamo-kyiv-crystal-palace-conference-league-match-report,"The Crystal Palace juggernaut is showing no signs of slowing down. Goals from Daniel Muñoz and the substitute Eddie Nketiah ensured Oliver Glasner’s side marked their first appearance in the main phase of a European competition with a comfortable victory over Dynamo Kyiv despite a late red card for Borna Sosa. It was the perfect reward for the 3,500 supporters who had made the pilgrimage from south London to southern Poland as Palace made it 19 games unbeaten in all competitions to establish a new club record that dates back more than 50 years. Against opponents who have enjoyed plenty of famous European nights in their storied history but are no longer the same force of old due to the ongoing war with Russia, there was only ever going to be one winner as Glasner’s side showed they are well equipped to go all the way to the final in Leipzig despite their inexperience at this level. “I’m proud that we could start the Conference League with a win, away, against very good opposition,” said Glasner. “I don’t think about this run, because this already happened, so for me, it’s important what comes next. And next comes Everton and a new stadium. Really looking forward to this game, great atmosphere, great stadium.” He may have played it down but you have to go all the way back to 1969 for the last time Palace managed to go undefeated for 18 games under their former manager Bert Head when they achieved promotion to the old First Division for the first time in their history. These days, the south Londoners are an established force in the Premier League and came into this match brimming with confidence after their superb performance in the win over Liverpool on Saturday courtesy of Nketiah’s late winner. Glasner’s opposite number Oleksandr Shovkovskyi rested half of his first-choice side for their league game at the weekend and the veteran former West Ham forward Andriy Yarmolenko was one of those recalled. Kyiv’s players emerged from the tunnel before kick-off with Ukrainian flags draped over their shoulders, with a similar number of home supporters in attendance at a ground that is 400 miles from their home. In a competition that they have started as the bookmakers’ favourites, Palace are likely to face a different challenge of having to break teams down rather than hitting them on the break. Aside from a dangerous cross from Yeremy Pino that Jean-Philippe Mateta just failed to make contact with in the 11th minute as he celebrated his first call-up to France’s senior squad, they struggled to create anything meaningful against a determined Kyiv defence. Maxence Lacroix required treatment after clashing heads with Taras Mykhavko midway through the first half, with the Kyiv defender having to be withdrawn after attempting to come back on. He left the pitch looking distinctly groggy. The Ukrainian champions did not even manage to replace him before they found themselves trailing. Pino found space down the left flank and drilled a cross to the back post, with Muñoz rising to somehow loop his header into the far corner. The Palace fans behind the goal could not contain their delight and responded to a subsequent request from the stadium announcer to only show “positive emotions” by launching into a loud chorus of anti-Uefa chants. Sosa had a golden opportunity to double their lead just before half-time but Ruslan Neshcheret was equal to his volley from Muñoz’s cross. With Sunday’s trip to Everton in mind, Glasner withdrew Mateta at the break and replaced him with Nketiah. He was forced into another change when Will Hughes went down a few minutes after the restart. Nketiah had the ball in the net after being set up by Adam Wharton, only for it to be ruled out for offside. But he did not have to wait long for another chance when Pino wriggled free down the left and the former Arsenal striker volleyed in his cross. Nketiah nearly scored again with a speculative shot from distance that was almost spilled into his own net by Neshcheret as Palace continued to dominate. Sosa’s decision to launch into a tackle on Oleksandr Tymchyk and earn himself a second yellow card three minutes after being shown his first could have put a dampener on Palace’s perfect day. But such is the quality of their defence these days that Palace never looked like conceding as they kicked off their Conference League campaign in style."
Phil Foden pushing for England recall after return to form for Manchester City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/02/phil-foden-pushing-for-england-recall-after-return-to-form-for-manchester-city,"Phil Foden is pushing for an England recall after enjoying a resurgence at Manchester City. The attacker asked to be left out of the squad in June, in part because he wanted to refocus by spending some time away from football after a difficult season, and was not picked by Thomas Tuchel for last month’s World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia. Foden struggled with an ankle knock during pre-season and has been working his way back to peak physical condition. The 25-year-old has impressed for City in recent weeks, particularly in victories over Manchester United and Napoli, and will hope to be involved when Tuchel names his latest squad on Friday. England, who host Wales in a friendly next Thursday and visit Latvia for their next qualifier on 14 October, have plenty of options in attacking midfield. But with Cole Palmer and Noni Madueke ruled out, there is an opening for Foden to come back into the fold. Jude Bellingham is also available after recovering from a shoulder operation. The challenge with Foden, who has scored twice in seven appearances this season, remains finding the right role for him at international level. He has dazzled in flashes but has lacked consistency and competition for places in attack is rising. Tuchel, who also has Bukayo Saka available again, wanted more from Foden when England beat Latvia and Albania in March. Another attacker hoping to be included is Jack Grealish, although the Everton winger may be left disappointed given that Newcastle’s Anthony Gordon and Barcelona’s Marcus Rashford have Tuchel’s trust at the moment. Grealish has not played for England since scoring in last year’s win over Finland. The Wales game gives Tuchel a chance to run the rule over a host of hopefuls. There are expected to be further opportunities for Tottenham’s Djed Spence and Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson and Morgan Gibbs-White. John Stones could return in defence after withdrawing from the last camp through injury while the absence of the Newcastle defender Tino Livramento gives Tuchel room to look at another full-back. Livramento’s Newcastle teammate Lewis Hall is back in contention and there are calls for Tuchel to consider the Crystal Palace left-back Tyrick Mitchell. An eye-catching move would be to bring the Arsenal defender Ben White back into the England picture. The Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton is in good form after pulling out of the September camp with an adductor injury."
"Spin the World Cup’s wheel of fortune: where you go, nobody knows!",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/02/football-daily-newsletter-world-cup-2026-tickets,"ROLL UP! ROLL UP? During a week when Wheel of Fortune made history by paying out its highest ever cash prize to a marketing manager from Connecticut, the first of the 4.5 million fans who have applied for Geopolitics World Cup tickets were selected to buy them through the system Fifa has named after the long-running American gameshow. While Christina Derevjanik walked away with $1,035,155, two different holidays and the best wishes of co-hosts Ryan Seacrest and Vanna White, those who got lucky in the Fifa equivalent will have to pay handsomely for the privilege of getting to watch matches despite not having the foggiest idea who will be playing in them until the draw is made. Although a certain, very small number of tickets for some group games will start at $60 (£44), for anyone who doesn’t mind sitting nearer the Kármán line than the halfway line, the key word is “start” because they could go for a lot more given Fifa’s decision to channel their inner Oasis and embrace the wheeze of dynamic pricing. With the cheapest tickets for next year’s final starting at $2,030 and the most expensive starting at $6,000, England fans hoping to see their team lift the trophy in New Jersey will be forced to budget and may have to stick considerably cheaper pre-match firecrackers where the sun don’t shine. Even your happy-clappy Football Daily accepts that, in an event where demand far outstrips supply, prices are always going to be unaffordable for the average Joe. But now it seems even those of us watching from the comparative comfort of our armchairs on this side of the Atlantic could have a late-night spanner thrown in the works. Due to concerns over the sweltering heat in certain host cities and the reluctance of modern, mollycoddled, namby-pamby footballers to play in conditions where they can hear their own skin crackle in the afternoon sun, it has been revealed some games featuring the cream of Europe could kick off after midnight UK time. “We’re in conversations daily with European broadcasters in terms of what stadiums you can play in at 3pm – the likes of Atlanta, for instance,” tooted Fifa’s Concacaf chief suit Victor Montagliani, who was unable to offer reassurances for European teams given the main influence on any decisions will more likely be based on “advice” from the likes of Adidas, Coca-Cola, Hyundai/Kia, Visa, Qatar Airways, McDonald’s, Aramco, etc and so on. With 11 cities in USA USA USA due to host 78 games between them, with the other 26 being played in Canada and Mexico, Infantino’s new bestie, Donald Trump, has threatened to remove games from cities such as San Francisco and Seattle, who are apparently “run by radical left lunatics who don’t know what they’re doing”. Trump has also vowed that Chicago “will be safe for the World Cup”, despite the Windy City not being among those slated to host games. With the draw for what promises to be the bigliest tournament ever due to take place in Washington DC on 5 December, Fifa insisted that the president has no jurisdiction to influence where games are played. “That’s the beauty of our game, it is bigger than any individual and bigger than any country,” added Montagliani, with a nervous peek over his shoulder.

USMNT squad: Antonee Robinson returns as Pochettino calls up 26 for friendlies,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/02/usmnt-squad-australia-ecuador-tyler-adams-antonee-robinson,"Mauricio Pochettino has named a 26-player roster for the US men’s national team’s upcoming friendlies against Ecuador and Australia that includes many familiar names – and has one very notable omission. Bournemouth midfielder Tyler Adams, a usual mainstay of the squad who captained the US at the 2022 World Cup, is not included, with Pochettino breaking the news that the midfielder is expecting his second child in the days to come. The squad is also notable for some significant returns. Antonee Robinson is back for the first time since undergoing knee surgery after the end of the last Premier League season, as does forward Patrick Agyemang after his summer transfer from Charlotte FC to Derby County. A few notable players will miss the friendlies due to injury, a group that includes Atlético Madrid midfielder Johnny Cardoso, Borussia Mönchengladbach midfielder Gio Reyna, and the PSV Eindhoven duo of forward Ricardo Pepi and defender Sergiño Dest. The US will play Ecuador on 10 October at 8.30pm ET in Austin, Texas before traveling north to Colorado to play Australia on 14 October at 9pm ET. Here are Pochettino’s selections and some initial takeaways: Goalkeepers Chris Brady (Chicago Fire), Matt Freese (New York City FC), Patrick Schulte (Columbus Crew), Matt Turner (New England Revolution) Turner returns to the squad after missing out on the last window, and once again he faces a tight competition for the No 1 shirt. This time around, he’ll be competing with NYC FC’s Freese, who was Pochettino’s preferred starter through the Gold Cup over the summer and friendlies afterward. Brady joins after a solid showing against Inter Miami in a wild midweek win, and Schulte will hope to translate another camp appearance into some game time with the first team. Defenders Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew), Cameron Carter-Vickers (Celtic), Alex Freeman (Orlando City), Mark McKenzie (FC Toulouse), Tim Ream (Charlotte FC), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace), Antonee Robinson (Fulham), Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati) The returning Robinsons, Antonee and Miles, highlight a group that is largely the same as the last few windows, with the notable exceptions of Tristan Blackmon (through injury) and Noahkai Banks. Fulham’s Robinson has only made scattered appearances off the bench for his club since returning from offseason knee surgery, but is fit enough to join the US squad after his absence this summer. With five center backs (Carter-Vickers, McKenzie, Ream, Richards and Miles Robinson), it seems likely that Pochettino could return to the three-at-the-back formation that worked so well for the US in a friendly win against Japan last time out. Midfielders Brenden Aaronson (Leeds United), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake), Weston McKennie (Juventus), Aidan Morris (Middlesbrough), Cristian Roldan (Seattle Sounders), James Sands (FC St Pauli), Tanner Tessmann (Olympique Lyon), Malik Tillman (Bayer Leverkusen) McKennie makes his return to the US squad for the first time since March’s disastrous Nations League final, with Club World Cup duty ruling him out for the summer games and Pochettino omitting him for the last pair of friendlies. His role will be interesting to suss out, especially in the absence of Adams. Morris returns for the first time since Pochettino’s debut international window a year ago, with Sands appearing for the first time. Both have started well for their clubs and could be a depth option come World Cup time with a good showing. Yunus Musah is another notable exclusion after mostly coming off the bench for Atalanta to start the season with his new club. Forwards Patrick Agyemang (Derby County), Folarin Balogun (AS Monaco), Christian Pulisic (Milan), Tim Weah (Marseille), Haji Wright (Coventry City), Alex Zendejas (Club América) Balogun and Zendejas performed well in their first US call-ups of 2025 last time. Agyemang’s inclusion follows a solid start to life in England with Derby Country – the forward was one of the big beneficiaries of Pochettino’s experimental Gold Cup squad. Pulisic enters this set of friendlies in arguably the best form of his career."
"Champions League review: PSG’s young guns, Valverde’s discontent and Qarabag shine",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/02/champions-league-review-psg-barcelona-rasmus-hojlund-marseille,"The big winners • The viewers. Barcelona v Paris Saint-Germain was the final many wanted last season. Wednesday’s group-stage meeting showed why. The fixture did not disappoint, even if, with red tape delaying the opening of the renovated Camp Nou, it was played in the less atmospheric Lluís Companys Stadium. Luis Enrique’s young Parisians staged a comeback in Catalonia, thanks to their coach’s expert use of his squad. Senny Mayulu, 19, upstaged Lamine Yamal by scoring the equaliser – Wednesday was the first match this season Yamal had failed to either score or contribute to a goal. Instead, the resurgent Marcus Rashford set up Ferran Torres’s opener for Barça. PSG were shorn of Ousmane Dembélé, Désiré Doué and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, the forward line that claimed last season’s crown. No matter: 23-year-old Bradley Barcola stepped up as the senior forward and ravaged Hansi Flick’s high-line, high-wire defence. The youngsters kept coming for PSG: 17-year-old Ibrahim Mbaye was replaced by another teenager, Quentin Ndjantou, to play alongside the lively Lee Kang-in. In the end, Achraf Hakimi supplied the assist for Gonçalo Ramos, another sub, to score the 90th minute winner and inflict Barcelona’s first loss this season. “If you’re the best team, you have to show it on the pitch, and not talk,” said Ramos, who habitually scores late goals off the bench. “We are the champions of Europe.” • Marseille. The French club were the inaugural winners of the rebadged Champions League in 1993, yet they have a troubled relationship with the competition. That triumph carries an asterisk: the club were stripped of their French title the same year for match fixing. This season, Roberto De Zerbi’s firebrand coaching could take them on a deep run. Having lost 2-1, and creditably, at Real Madrid and beaten PSG last week in Ligue 1, Marseille crushed another former winner in Ajax, 4-0 in a raucous Stade Velodrome. De Zerbi’s squad is a mix of waifs and strays, many familiar to Premier League audiences. Against Ajax, Mason Greenwood repeated his influential showing in Madrid. His goal followed Brazilian partner Igor Paixão’s early double. The fourth came from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who is still enjoying his football at the age of 36. De Zerbi, usually a terse taskmaster, was gushing: “I like the way my players work, the fun they have, and the relationship they create with the fans.” • Manchester United are nowhere near this season’s competition but Napoli’s Rasmus Højlund is the latest player to thrive once no longer weighed down by the red shirt. Two goals from the Dane, banished to the “bomb squad” by Ruben Amorim last season, showed why United paid Atalanta £68m for him in 2023 (and why United will take a £26m hit should his loan to Napoli be made permanent). Another former Manchester resident, Kevin De Bruyne, supplied two laser-guided assists in Napoli’s 2-1 win over Sporting. “Kevin is a legend of this sport and when he has the ball, I know that with his quality he will always put it perfectly for me,” said Højlund. Player of the week Jens Petter Hauge, Bodø/Glimt. It took a late own-goal to deny Bodo/Glimt the victory over Tottenham they probably deserved. Hauge, a star of the Norwegian club’s run to last season’s Europa League semi-final after returning to his home town from spells at Milan and Eintracht Frankfurt, scored twice against Spurs this week. Both goals saw him cutting in from the wing to lash home. They said it “I know I’ve played poorly in some matches, I am aware of it. I’m not hiding … People can say many things about me, but under no circumstances can they say that I refuse to play. I have given everything, and even more, for this club. I’ve played through fractures, injuries, and never once have I complained or asked for a rest. I have a good relationship with the coach, which gives me the confidence to tell him which position I prefer … always, I’ve made it clear that I am available to play in any position, in any away game, and in every match.” Federico Valverde, a non-playing sub in Real Madrid’s win at Kairat, takes to social media to deny rumours of a rift with Xabi Alonso and refusing to play at right-back in the absence of Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dani Carvajal. The pundit’s chair “Right now, he needs to come out of the team, Liverpool need to go back to what they were last season, and try to build some confidence and some stability. Right now it looks like a mess.” Jamie Carragher’s takedown of Liverpool summer signing Florian Wirtz on CBS, following their 1-0 defeat to Galatasaray. Looking ahead • Among the teams on two wins from two are Qarabag, who beat FC Copenhagen 2-0 in Baku after victory over Benfica in Portugal in their opener. Qurban Qurbanov is a legend of Azerbaijani football, a goal-plundering forward turned coach of the Land of Fire’s serial champions, his reign stretching to 17 years. The club’s first group stage appearance since 2017-18, only their second overall, could hardly be going better. Next up for Qarabag, Athletic Club, who are on zero points after their 4-1 loss to Borussia Dortmund. Can Qurbanov’s men go three for three? • Two players coming into form are Arsenal’s Martin Ødegaard, full of creativity against Olympiakos on Wednesday, and Julián Alvarez, who starred in Atlético Madrid’s weekend derby crushing of Real Madrid. The Argentinian scored a late penalty in Tuesday’s 5-1 defeat of Eintracht Frankfurt. When Atlético visit the Emirates later this month, there will be a familiar face in the directors’ box. Andrea Berta, the sporting director who signed the players for Diego Simeone’s Atléti dynasty, now heads Arsenal’s transfer business. • Real Madrid v Juventus is a history-laden meeting of two of the most haughty members of European football’s elite. The 1998 and 2017 finals were both won by the Spanish club though Juve have won 10 of the 21 meetings in Uefa competition to Madrid’s nine. Madrid won their most recent meeting, 1-0 in Miami, during the summer’s Club World Cup."
Masters denies Premier League transfer spending is damaging European football,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/02/masters-denies-premier-league-transfer-spending-is-damaging-european-football,"Richard Masters, the Premier League’s chief executive, has denied that the English top flight’s transfer spending is damaging European football, arguing instead that it “breathes life” into rival competitions. Masters made the claim as he took stock of the Premier League’s global position and laid out plans for its growth. Noting that England’s elite clubs had a “bigger share of the world’s best players” from this summer’s record-breaking £3bn spending, Masters said: “Seven of our clubs were net recipients in lots of inter-Premier League transfers. But a lot of that money does percolate out of the big European leagues, a substantial portion of that, and breathes life into their own transfer markets. So I don’t see how it’s suffocating [the European game]. “I think there is a clear juxtaposition between the amounts of money being spent on the Premier League and the other leagues. But I think that’s a good thing. Provided it’s within the rules, it’s a good thing. It shapes our competition. And it’s an indication that our clubs want to drive supporter interest, and it’s the interest in the audience which drives our media values.” The Premier League’s financial dominance has long been underpinned by its media revenues and Masters, who was speaking at The Summit, part of Leaders Week London, said the competition had seen 27% growth in revenues “term on term” in international markets. He defended the longstanding model of selling deals to broadcasters in individual markets but said the Premier League was also “stepping towards” launching its own one-stop digital broadcast service, with a revamped Premier League Productions set to open new studios in the capital. “Premier League Studios is opening up in Olympia next summer,” Masters confirmed. “So we’re putting ourselves in the supply chain, the content supply chain, principally to serve our international broadcast partners and so that we have stronger control over the content. “But it also gives us the option to go forward, and we have also relaunched our digital platforms this summer with the objective of getting closer to fans. So we’re stepping towards that optionality. I don’t think there will ever be … a switch-on-switch-off moment for the Premier League.” On the subject of the 3pm blackout, by which UK broadcasters are prevented from showing live games played at the traditional Saturday kick-off time, Masters said the Premier League remained committed to it for “a certain foreseeable future”. But he argued there was no room to further grow broadcast offerings without a shift in the policy. “Our current domestic broadcast arrangements means that we are now essentially licensed to the outer limit,” he said."
Montpellier just the start as Smith aims to ‘walk the walk’ in multi-club ownership,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/02/montpellier-crux-sports-multi-club-ownership-bex-smith,"“I wanted to try to build something that I wish had existed when I was playing.” At the core, that is what has driven Bex Smith, the former New Zealand captain, to set up a multi-club ownership group and attempt to create environments for women’s teams that her generation could only dream of. On Wednesday, her vision took a step towards reality as her investment group Crux Football completed the purchase of their first team, buying a 100% stake in the French club Montpellier. Smith says the acquisition of more clubs will follow and, while Crux Football is a new name for the sport, there are familiar figures among their investors, not least the legendary former USA captain Julie Foudy. But Smith, who founded the company and is the chief executive, is calling the shots and, in an interview with the Guardian, the two-time Olympian explains why Montpellier and why France but also – given all the different careers a retired player could try to pursue after hanging up their boots – why club ownership? “As a tiny kid, I never actually wanted to be a professional footballer. That was not really my dream – I just kind of fell in love with football [but] I always thought I wanted to be an entrepreneur like my parents and do something that I really was passionate about,” says Smith, who has a masters degree in psychology and initially moved into a competitions manager role at Fifa after retiring, working on the 2019 Women’s World Cup where one of the hosts cities was, incidentally, Montpellier. “I thought: ‘How can you make the biggest impact in the game?’ That’s always been my goal,” says Smith. “How can we get positive, sustainable growth into the women’s game? Now I really feel like the club women’s game is exploding. Some clubs, in some ways, do really great things, but then often they’ll be good at one side like the commercial or media, but maybe not necessarily as good on the pitch, or they’re really good on the pitch but not really necessarily taking care of the media or the visibility of the players, the storytelling, commercial partnerships. And so I really wanted to try to have a go at running clubs in a way that, from a player perspective, I would have liked. “Our model is very player-centric – we will start from the players first and give them what they need. From there, you build the team around the team. What I see when I talk to players and hear people in women’s clubs, is they always say it’s the same issue: ‘We don’t have enough resources. It could be so much better. It could be so much bigger.’ And the fanbase is dying to see more of their team in a better way, in a more professional way.” Smith sees potential in Montpellier, who finished sixth in the French top flight last term and this season are currently 10th of 12 teams, after losing all three of their opening games. She says their “Barcelona-quality pitches” were one of many attractions, and more broadly felt the investments coming into the French league made it a great time to enter that market. To try to ensure they have local expertise, they have appointed Paul Bouffard, previously credited with successfully growing Bordeaux’s women’s team between 2018 and 2022, and the new president of Montpellier Féminines. Smith has secured investment in Crux Football from several notable figures, including the former Netflix vice-president Cindy Holland and her partner, Anne Imhof, who were previously early-stage investors in the NWSL club Angel City. Also part of the group is Ted Knutson, the founder and chief executive of StatsBomb, a huge player in the football data industry, and the global head of sport at EssenceMediacom, Misha Sher, who has dedicated many years of his career to women’s football and has worked with player and coach clients including the former Arsenal manager and current San Diego Wave head coach, Jonas Eidevall. It is a list of names that will mean people take notice. Yet, they are in an increasingly crowded environment, with more and more investors trying to buy women’s clubs. The American businesswoman Michele Kang has bought OL Lyonnes, Washington Spirit and London City, and another multi-club ownership group, Mercury13, added the English second-tier club Bristol City to their portfolio in September. Smith believes more and more multi-club groups could follow in the women’s game: “The trajectory has been phenomenal and so quick, those that were offered teams five years ago are kicking themselves because they didn’t get in. “I do think that there’s going to be a massive influx of investment into the women’s game. I think the things that sort of differentiate us from potentially others – and by the way, I think it’s amazing that there are others out there that are investing – is what I’ve experienced and that’s through the lens of being a player, wanting to set global standards for what players need.” What next, and where next? Smith says it will not be long before more clubs follow. “We are moving quite quickly on that front. Potentially already as early as early next year, it’s possible that we could be closing our second club. It’s possible that even the third club could be somewhere around summer or fall [autumn] of next year. So we are looking to move quite fast because our model is about scale and it’s about bringing all of the skill set and expertise that we have into as many clubs as we can. “But we also want to be wary that we do it right, that we spend the time that we need to with Montpellier because it’s a hefty club. That is for sure our focus right now. We’ve been trying to stay a little bit covert and we have been a bit quiet because I like to walk the walk before we talk the talk.” Get in touch If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email moving.goalposts@theguardian.com.

Martinelli welcomes competition for places as Arsenal’s squad depth fuels belief,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/02/martinelli-welcomes-competition-for-places-as-arsenal-squad-depth-fuels-belief,"Gabriel Martinelli started the sequence when he came off the bench to open the scoring in Arsenal’s 2-0 Champions League win at Athletic Bilbao last month. He continued it when he came on again in their next game to conjure the stoppage-time equaliser against Manchester City in the Premier League. And together with everyone at Arsenal, not least Mikel Arteta, who has not stopped talking about the importance of “finishers”, he can luxuriate in how it has grown. When Bukayo Saka was introduced to score the clinching goal in Wednesday’s 2-0 Champions League victory over Olympiakos, it was the fifth match in a row that an Arsenal substitute had found the net. Game three had seen Leandro Trossard seal the 2-0 Carabao Cup win at Port Vale while game four featured Mikel Merino’s equaliser in the 2-1 victory at Newcastle. You have to go back to the beginning of the 2004-05 season for the last time that Arsenal had goals from the bench in five successive matches, which, of course, was Invincibles territory. Game numbers 41 to 45 of the fabled 49-match unbeaten league run were marked by goals, in wins, from substitutes: Robert Pires (twice), José Antonio Reyes (twice) and Dennis Bergkamp. Some replacements, right? The point is that arguably the greatest squad in club history had enviable depth – and those were the days when only three substitutions were allowed. Nobody is comparing Arteta’s current crop with those legends, but as they seek to emulate them by winning the Premier League, ending the club’s painfully long wait in the process, it is the range of difference-makers that the manager can call on which is fuelling belief. Arsenal have had tough fixtures in the opening six rounds of their league campaign, with trips to Manchester United, Liverpool and Newcastle, plus the home game against City. Also, they have been hit hard by injuries, with William Saliba, Martin Ødegaard, Saka and Kai Havertz among those to miss matches. There was a time – in particular last season – when the loss of these kinds of players would have led to communal angst, Arteta looking as though he was ready to self-combust. But there is no doubt that after the £250m spree over the summer, the club are better prepared to weather the selection storms when they come. Which they always will. Arsenal have dropped points in only two matches so far – the defeat at Liverpool and the draw with City. They have conceded only three times in all competitions. They are second in the league, two points behind Liverpool and have won both of their Champions League ties. There is a clear sense of power and purpose. Martinelli was back in the starting XI against Olympiakos and he scored the opening goal. Would he rather be in the lineup at the outset? Yes. Is the Brazil winger being pushed to a higher level by the competition, including from the new signings Eberechi Eze and Noni Madueke, albeit the latter is now injured? Also, yes. “It’s the same in the national team for me,” Martinelli said. “I’m not going to complain to have Vinícius Júnior and Rodrygo and Raphinha playing with me. I’m really happy to have them there and I’m happy to have the players that we have here, as well. “We play for Arsenal. We have to use every single one that is available. So, if someone gets injured, we’re going to try to use someone else. This is why we have a huge squad right now.” It is impossible to ignore the feeling that, after three straight runners-up finishes in the league, only the title will do this time. Which means excruciating pressure. And yet, at the same time, a cold-blooded focus. The eyes of everybody at the club are firmly on the prize. Next up for them is West Ham at home on Saturday. “Every tournament that we go into, we go to win,” Martinelli said. “Every game that we play, we want to win. Of course, we want to win the big trophies. This is what we’ve been working for. “They [the near misses] have to hurt because we want to win. It’s just to try to learn from the past three seasons and with the signings we’ve brought in, let’s try to use this squad. It’s a long season and with a big squad, we have more opportunities to win.”"
Rodri replacements in short supply with Manchester City’s metronome lacking rhythm,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/02/rodri-replacements-in-short-supply-with-manchester-city-midfield-metronome-lacking-rhythm,"Patience is required for Rodri, Manchester City’s metronomic midfielder. Returning from something as serious as a cruciate ligament injury was never going to be straightforward. He made a tentative comeback at the end of last season after months out and continues to readjust to a role the Ballon d’Or winner had made his own. Pep Guardiola has been quite clear that Rodri cannot yet cope with the rigours of playing three games in a week and, as such, it was no surprise to see him withdraw the 29-year-old after an hour of the 2-2 draw in Monaco, having left him out entirely of the weekend win over Burnley. For someone of Rodri’s quality, tThere are no concerns that Rodri will not get back to his best, but the mechanics of the body need to match up with the mind and that, understandably, is not instantaneous after such a major setback. What it also clear is that City need to evaluate their succession plan. Nico González replaced his compatriot at the Stade Louis II and made headlines by introducing his shin pad to Eric Dier’s face in the dying moments of the game. That moment of poor decision-making cost his side victory and since joining from Porto for almost £50m, the 23-year-old has rarely given the impression of being a long-term replacement for Rodri. Admittedly, he has improved this season following a period of acclimatisation to life in England, but it remains doubtful that he can be a key defensive member of a team challenging for silverware in the Premier League and in Europe. Mateo Kovacic has watched from the bench in the past two games after recovering from surgery. The Croat was the preferred option in the No 6 role during Rodri’s absence, offering a combative alternative, aided by being more accustomed to the Premier League than González,but he too is not a long-term replacement, especially given he is 31. The second part of the midfield pairing is Tijjani Reijnders, who continues to evolve in the role Guardiola wants him to play. The Dutchman can often be found on the edge of the opposition box, eagerly wanting to shoot. He is clearly a technically gifted player but needs to use the ball quicker when City are facing low blocks, as they did in midweek. And in general, he is not a Rodri replacement. Finding an understudy for Rodri has always been difficult because his list of personal and team accolades speak for themselves. Kalvin Phillips was quickly deemed unable to cope with the complexities and responsibility of a pivotal role, becoming an early victim of Rodri’s supreme competence. It was in Monaco in 2017 that Guardiola learned how much needed to change at City, going on to overhaul the squad after exiting the Champions League to a side that contained Fabinho, Bernardo Silva and an 18-year-old Kylian Mbappé. After a sustained period of success, only tweaks now need to be made, especially after heavy investment in recent windows. Guardiola is rightly sensing a good season ahead for his team, although their performance in Monaco did not point to a return yet to their best form in Europe. City suffered from lapses in concentration against the Ligue 1 side, resulting in too much space for the opener and that late kick to the face by González. In general they are relying too heavily on the efficiency in front of goal that Erling Haaland provides, his two goals in midweek taking his tally for the season to an extraordinary 11 in eight appearances. That is something of a short-term concern; long term there remains the glaring need to put together a successful succession plan for Rodri. If City were to look inside the Premier League for an alternative, Elliot Anderson at Nottingham Forest or Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton are at the right age and have the right attributes and attitude to compete with the Spaniard and, potentially, replace him. The cogs will be whirring in City’s recruitment room, with those involved looking at various No 6s around the world. None will have Rodri’s skillset and ability, but that does not mean that the search can stop. Phillips, Kovacic and González have been unable to compete with Rodri; the next in through the door simply cannot follow the same path."
Pitch points: why are United sticking with Amorim? And is Pulisic really that good?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/02/ruben-amorim-manchester-united-arsenal,"Why haven’t United sacked Amorim yet? It’s no wonder Ruben Amorim spent the closing moments of Manchester United’s defeat to Brentford staring at the floor. That’s the only place he can escape the reality of his team’s continued slide. United’s latest defeat means the Portuguese manager has now lost nearly twice as many matches (17) as he has won (nine). Under Amorim, United have taken just 31 points from 31 Premier League matches, giving him the worst record of the club’s five permanent post-Sir Alex Ferguson managers after the same number of games. The most successful club of the Premier League era are closer to relegation than another title. Firing Amorim, though, would be politically significant. CEO Omar Berrada reportedly pushed hard for his appointment nearly a year ago, as did sporting director Jason Wilcox. Amorim’s hiring was the first major move of the Sir Jim Ratcliffe age and so his firing would raise questions over Ineos’s involvement in all this. Plus, some adjustment time was always meant to be part of Amorim’s process. Last season’s 15th place finish was far from ideal, but a rebuild was always going to be painful and so United willingly endured their worst league campaign for over five decades in the belief it would ultimately lead to the “good days,” Amorim promised. Those good days, however, still seem a long way off. Saturday at the Gtech Community Stadium certainly wasn’t one. Amorim’s refusal to budge from his trademark 3-4-3 system is becoming the defining issue of his tenure, but the truth is there are countless other problems dragging Manchester United down. At some point, United may have to read up on the sunk-cost fallacy. Why did Arsenal’s win at Newcastle matter so much? The celebration police surely raised an eyebrow at how Arsenal reacted to the final whistle on Sunday. Match winner Gabriel Magalhães dropped to his knees. Mikel Arteta tightly embraced his coaching staff. The away support high in the nosebleeds at St James’ Park went nuts. All this for a win that only lifted the Gunners to second, still two points behind Liverpool. Victory in the north-east was about more than three points for Arsenal, though. It was a result, and comeback from 1-0 down, that quelled some of the criticism faced by Arteta and his players. If the recent performances against Liverpool and Manchester City were too timid for a team chasing the title, Sunday’s display was anything but. Arsenal beat Newcastle at their own game. They physically matched them. The intensity was there from the start and even more so when Nick Woltemade opened the scoring against the run of play. Other teams would have crumbled, but the visitors were determined to make a point. For Arsenal, being second is nothing to celebrate. That’s where they’ve finished in each of the last three Premier League seasons. Sunday’s full-time scenes were so visceral because the comeback could be a catalyst for a sustained, and ultimately successful, title challenge, Arsenal’s first for over two decades. Not even the celebration police could begrudge that party. Has any American male player been as good as Pulisic is right now? Christian Pulisic scored what proved to be the winner in Sunday’s blockbuster Serie A clash between Milan and Napoli, but that wasn’t even his best moment of the match. That came just three minutes in when Pulisic skipped past a tackle, surged into the box and picked out a teammate at the back post for a simple finish in a way no other player on the pitch could have replicated. It’s difficult to envision another male American player being able to produce such brilliance at such a high standard on such a regular basis. So the answer to the titular question is simple: No. Pulisic is operating at a level that none of his compatriots have ever matched. Not Landon Donovan. Not Clint Dempsey. No one. Of course, Pulisic has been a high-level performer for Milan for the last two seasons. Even as the Rossoneri fell apart last season, going through three managers in just a few months, the American found a way to consistently impact matches, registering 25 goal contributions in all competitions. He certainly wasn’t to blame for Milan finishing eighth. Now, though, Pulisic has the framework around him to hit even higher heights. Max Allegri is using the 27-year-old as a secondary forward in a role that affords him the freedom to drift. And dribble. And create. And shoot, all of which Pulisic did in a 2-1 win for Milan that marked them out as genuine Scudetto contenders. The best player for the best team in Serie A is an American."
"West Ham tumble in modern football’s global vortex, with home now a distant memory",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/02/west-ham-modern-football-home-distant-memory-upton-park-london-stadium,"Graham Potter still turned up for work on Saturday morning, even though there was no work left for him to do. A team meeting was arranged, at which Potter announced to general bewilderment that he had been sacked. Potter left. Training was delayed because nobody was available to take it. Eventually the new coach, Nuno Espírito Santo, arrived on site and hastily began preparations for the Everton game on Monday. Perhaps on reflection it was inevitable that West Ham United’s big set-piece appointment went the same way many of their set pieces have gone this season. “We’re not West Ham any more,” disgruntled fans have been chanting at recent protests against the club’s ownership, but consider the evidence. A bungled sacking. A fiesta of contradictory leaks and briefings. Chaotic performances on the pitch. A vacuum of leadership and direction. Catastrophic recruitment. An early relegation battle. Fans in open revolt. I don’t know. Sounds pretty West Ham to me. In many ways Nuno is the perfect manager for the current shambles, which is not entirely a compliment. Nuno will sort out the leaky defence, inject some energy in midfield, get the team running as a unit, put some points on the board, turn a diplomatic cheek to the foibles around him and extravagances above him. He will not become a face‑swap meme. He will not go on Monday Night Football to point at a large television and explain what a genius he is. But what he will also not do is provide any wider sense of mission and purpose, offer any broader footballing vision beyond the creation of numerical overloads, give this restless and desperately sick club any clearer idea of its place in the world. The protests may subside. There may even be some decent, stirring football and a tilt at Europe some day. But West Ham have had these things in the past and it has not brought them peace, because what they lack is ultimately something far deeper and more existential. What makes the identity of a football club? Place, people, history, memories, symbols, songs. On raw materials alone, West Ham should be one of the easiest sells in English football: an east London institution attracting 62,000 a week, the eighth-longest serving club in the Premier League. In a league run by opaque funds and investment instruments, it is one of the very few in local ownership. David Sullivan grew up in Hornchurch and his late co‑owner, David Gold, lived on Green Street. There is a culture and authenticity, a community and a global brand, and plenty of cash to burn. How do you get this so wrong? Perhaps the enduring paradox of West Ham is that while it has always been a club in London, it has never truly been a London club. More correctly it is an East End club, a part of town with its own character and outlook, its own rituals and vernacular, the grizzled pride that comes with being outsiders in your own city. Not tourist London, not establishment London, but a kind of walled fortress where everyone held tight, where everyone knew who they were because – importantly – everyone knew where they were. The London Stadium was conceived as a world-class athletics venue and perhaps the kindest thing you can say about it today is that it remains a world-class athletics venue. The shallow rake efficiently disperses the noise up the back straight; the high distant seats offer a magnificent view of the javelin competition. There is a nice canal alongside and as much boutique street food as you can eat. But a walled fortress it is not, and can never be. And frankly it is the most visible symptom, if not the underlying cause, of modern West Ham. The stadium has secured the future of West Ham, but at the expense of its present. And put yourself in Sullivan’s and Gold’s shoes for a moment. You took over a club nursing nine-figure debts, competing in a rapidly overheating league populated by billionaires and nation-states. You are not men of football but men of numbers, and in this landscape all your principles are secondary to the first: you must not, under any circumstances, get relegated next May. Everything flows from this survival instinct. This is why West Ham have a squad full of short-term fixes, assembled with no real vision or coherent idea. £40m for Max Kilman, £27m for Nicklas Füllkrug … £7m to take Kalvin Phillips on loan. This is why, of the 86 players signed for a fee since the takeover, only three – Dimitri Payet, Flynn Downes and Mohammed Kudus – have turned a significant profit. This is also, by the way, how you end up hiring a head of recruitment in January and most likely sacking him before the year is out. This is why, despite being situated in one of the richest talent seams in the sport, not a single academy player born since 2000 has become a regular Premier League starter. The potential is out there. Ezri Konsa played at Senrab up the road. Rio Ngumoha learned his football in the five-a-side cages of Newham. Ayden Heaven was in the West Ham academy until the age of 13. The under-18s won the Youth Cup a couple of years ago, and most of them are still at the club. But for reasons of opportunity or circumstance, quicker movers or richer predators, this is no longer a place where you can envisage local talent flourishing. The money is clearly there, too. Premier League revenue, European revenue, the Declan Rice fee, sell‑outs every week, the removal of many concessionary ticket categories: why is there so little evidence of West Ham’s richness where it matters? Perhaps this explains the sense of bitterness between the fans and the boardroom: the sheer scale of waste, the pure disconnect between a fanbase feeling increasingly poor and an ownership throwing bad money after bad, between a fanbase invested for life and a board that can barely see beyond the weekend. Meanwhile your owner has become increasingly elusive and your vice-chair has a weekly column in the Sun explaining why you all just need to chill out, actually. And on some level the tale of West Ham is a parable for something larger than West Ham, something larger even than football. The feeling of loss and dislocation, communities broken up and parcelled off, the total absence of control and agency, the suspicion that your toil and your tears are making somebody else rich. And few places have endured this process as swiftly or violently as east London: a community essentially uprooted from itself, stripped and gentrified, flooded with investment that somehow always seems to be flowing somewhere else. You can still visit Upton Park now, but it looks a little different these days. The old ground was broken up and sold off for housing. Ken’s Café on Green Street is now something called Bad Boyz Diner. The old supporters’ club headquarters is now a gym. You can buy a flat in Lyall House or Sealey Tower, stroll along Ironworks Way, sit in the Boleyn Ground memorial garden that has been landscaped in a bubble-themed design. Place, people, history, memories, symbols, songs, a 24-hour concierge and private balconies. You ask who West Ham are these days. Perhaps a better question would be where."
Ødegaard and Gyökeres on centre stage as Arteta’s Arsenal plan takes shape,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/01/degaard-and-gyokeres-on-centre-stage-as-artetas-arsenal-plan-takes-shape,"And … breathe. As Bukayo Saka shot low, hard and ultimately through Kostas Tzolakis in the Olympiakos goal to complete an occasionally uncomfortable 2-0 win, the noise from the home crowd was more a weary, sofa-flopping sigh than a roar of triumph, with the sense, finally, of a midweek putting-to-bed. This was a game Arsenal always looked like they were winning, despite seeming to realise this a little too early in the piece against eager and purposeful opponents. Nobody attracts the stern and unforgiving eye quite like this Arsenal team, for whom squad depth, the unforgivable act of acquiring a potentially title‑winning team, is the latest crime on the rap sheet. But sometimes you really do just need to get the job done. Even at kick-off the Emirates Stadium felt like a workaday place, an extension of the rush hour high street just beyond the hard white lights, London urgency, nine to five football, a necessary task as we head now toward that part of the year when the lights come on at four and the season really starts to shift gears. Victory aside, two interesting things happened here for Arsenal. Martin Ødegaard played 90 minutes. And Victor Gyökeres also played 90 minutes. They did so in differing ways. Ødegaard was brilliant, even in the period when Arsenal were not, and this is important: 84 touches, four shots, an assist, a reel of delightful passes, nudges, prompts. He really is a lovely player to watch when he performs like this, part feather-footed artist, part furiously unforgiving press-machine, veering about like a drop of water in a pan of hot oil. Gyökeres was Gyökeres: energetically blunt, haring about the place from first to last like a man being chased by a sheep dog. But Gyökeres was also interesting because he speaks progress, different patterns, and to wanting more. And there are points to be digested now, albeit this game wasn’t really one of them. This was the second Evangelos Marinakis vehicle Arsenal had come up against in the past three weeks and Marinakis was duly present in $500 white T-shirt and California vice-squad silky blazer, the look of a man who at any given moment is either on his way to a speed boat, has just got off a speed boat, or is on a speed boat, ideally accompanied by a group of ponytailed men over a soft-metal soundtrack. There were some fun crowd moments early on. José Luis Mendilibar, the excitable Olympiakos manager, became embroiled in a tangle with the fourth official, a vast terrifying bald man, like the bouncer at the entrance to a nightclub only for bouncers. On the Olympiakos left Ben White, 6ft 1in, marking Daniel Podence, 5ft 4in, had vague take‑your-dad-to-school vibes. And for a while this threatened to become a stroll, with an opening goal made by Ødegaard and Gyökeres. It was a beautiful thing, a feather-light brush stroke followed by a fist straight through the canvas. First Ødegaard did something smart, drifting into a half-space between midfield and defence, jinking past his man then playing a perfect pass between two grey shirts into the run of Gyökeres. From that point, enter: the Smashing Machine, Gyökeres basically ran through two defenders, before blasting a shot through Tzolakis. As the ball trickled towards goal Gabriel Martinelli tried to let it run in, then smacked in the rebound off the post. This was the best of Gyökeres, who often doesn’t look like a very good basic footballer in this company, but doesn’t seem to mind, or feel cowed. Olympiacos gave him some rough stuff after the goal. He was jounced and bumped and barged. He got up, came back for more. Gyökeres is just a different beast, in this team, with that distinctive way of running with the ball, not so much dribbling as kicking it forward and then running after it, like a Great Dane chasing a beach ball. He’s a bludgeon. But this is OK. Arsenal didn’t actually have a bludgeon before. He will need to get better, quicker to shoot, more precise when the competition narrows. But this is also significant, because Gyokeres is also the only part of this re-geared team still waiting to click. This is not quite a moment to pause: that will only come after West Ham on Saturday, but Arsenal can now at the very least adjust their crampons and take a mouthful of Kendal mint cake. It always looked like the autumn fixtures would break down into two distinct parts. The first of those is now behind them. Eight games in six weeks, among those Manchester United, Liverpool, Nottingham Forest, Manchester City and Newcastle, and bookended here with a tricky night against the Greek champions. At the end of that the record reads: won seven, lost one, drawn one with five clean sheets. There are intangibles, too. Goals spread all over the team, and still only one conceded from open play. They have cover for Saka, cover at the back, cover for Ødegaard. Best of all Mikel Arteta has shown dynamism, has learned on the job, has been impressively fluid and urgent with his patterns in the last three games, in a time of self-hobbling systems fetishism elsewhere. This is not the beginning of anything just yet. This is not even the end of the beginning. But the next eight games are, in outline, a decent run by comparison, with five league games that look winnable and the Champions League now under control. All things being equal, and with Ødegaard zipping about once again, there is a sense here of credit being squirrelled away. And almost, but not quite, time to take a breath."
Pep Guardiola makes ‘Spanish referees’ remark after Manchester City held to draw,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/01/pep-guardiola-makes-spanish-referees-remark-after-manchester-city-held-to-draw,"Pep Guardiola has “nothing to say to Spanish referees” after Manchester City dropped two points in Monaco thanks to a last-minute Eric Dier penalty. Jesús Gil Manzano was sent to the screen by the video assistant referee before awarding the spot-kick after he adjudged Nico González’s high boot against the English centre-back merited punishment. Erling Haaland scored twice for City but they were pegged back on two occasions through Jordan Teze and Dier’s late penalty. It had been a dominant performance from City but they fell short at the end. Guardiola did not want to discuss the penalty decision after the match and referred to officials from his homeland generally. The City head coach previously had a difficult relationship with his compatriot Antonio Mateu Lahoz, who awarded three penalties against his team in as many Champions League matches and booked Sergio Agüero for a dive in a match against Monaco when a spot-kick was merited. The decision to award the late penalty cost City two points. “We played a really good game,” Guardiola said. “In football you have to win with the result. If you analyse the game there were many things that were very good. Step by step we will be better but we had many chances and Phil [Foden] in the first half and many players played really good. We conceded almost nothing. “They defended so deep and tight, that is so different to the way Monaco play in Ligue 1, but we played really good. When it’s close, you have to defend and we take the point.” Haaland’s two goals were only good enough for a draw in the end, as he took his Champions League tally to a startling 52 in 50 appearances. “It isn’t good enough,” the Norwegian striker said of the team’s performance. “We have to try and win the next game. It is the only thing we can do. “We need more energy. We needed to get at them more like in the first half, they took the lead in the second half and I don’t think it’s good enough.” Of the penalty award he said: “I didn’t see it – but if you kick someone in the face, it’s probably a penalty.”"
Paris Saint-Germain stun Barcelona with late Gonçalo Ramos winner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/01/barcelona-paris-saint-germain-match-report,"The goal that won this game was a portrait of how it had been played: all in, all the way to the end. A move that started deep in Paris Saint-Germain’s half with Lee Kang-in chased backwards, turning, escaping and going at the same opponents who had been pursuing him, ended in the Barcelona penalty area with Gonçalo Ramos slotting past Wojciech Szczesny. There were six seconds left, it was the 26th shot of an exhausting and enjoyable night, and now it really was over, Barcelona beaten. For an hour of generous effort and high quality, they had gone at each other; for the last half an hour, as Barcelona tired and PSG somehow didn’t, Luis Enrique’s side kept pressing and ultimately justice was done. The European champions still look a step ahead even with illustrious absentees, the Ballon d’Or winner, Ousmane Dembélé, among them. Everywhere, in both sides, players caught the eye, as much for the commitment as the quality, the speed at which everything happened, the intent in every action, the refusal to step back from the edge. They had gone at each other from the start. Fabián Ruiz sent the ball straight out from kick-off, his teammates sprinting after it in a pack, pressing Barcelona from the first throw. Ferran Torres, roared by the crowd, then slid in on Lucas Chevalier on 35 seconds. If that was a statement of intent, what to call what followed? Achraf Hakimi had warned that this time Lamine Yamal faced the world’s best left-back and that, anyway, they would try not to leave Nuno Mendes one on one. So the first time he got the ball, on 85 seconds, Lamine Yamal took on three instead, spinning away, roulette included, to set up an opening for Torres and what for a while felt like a personal battle. The next time Lamine Yamal got possession, a drop of the shoulder took him away again only for Mendes to recover. Then an outrageous pass with the outside of his foot, travelling like a curler’s stone sliding home across the rink, found Torres. The striker went round Chevalier and shot towards what he thought was an unguarded goal only for Illia Zabarnyi to fly in from out of shot and block it. When Barcelona took the lead it had started with Lamine Yamal’s alertness too but the decisive touch came from the other wing and an increasingly familiar source, Marcus Rashford’s first-time ball setting up Torres to score. For the sixth successive game Rashford had a goal or an assist and there might have been more: a shot blocked was followed by a run stopped at the last as he sought Dani Olmo. By then PSG were level. A man for whom “defender” is a woefully inadequate description, Mendes came flying out and through the middle of the field, going past people like Carl Lewis at a school sports day. Frenkie de Jong took him out, but the studs on Mendes’s achilles didn’t stop him doing it again soon after: now he rocketed past Jules Koundé to set up Senny Mayulu, who finished. PSG should have led before the break too, Bradley Barcola evading Gerard Martín and firing over. Still they went at it. Fast feet enabled Barcola to rattle off a shot that Szczesny blocked and Pau Cubarsi blocked Hakimi. Then a superb tackle from Eric García saved Barcelona one second and released them the next. The move ended when Lamine Yamal was taken down by a foul on the edge of the area which should have come with a second yellow for Mendes. Almost immediately, another dash and perfectly delivered diagonal from Rashford found Lamine Yamal, who set up Olmo; Hakimi produced a fantastic block almost on the line. Yet PSG were tilting the balance. Lee hit the post. Mendes’s last act before departing was to force a save. And, with time slipping away and Lee chased down, he escaped to start one last move. There was Vitinha, as always, making sense of it all. There too was Hakimi somehow still running, space opening before him, opportunity too. Invited in, he provided the perfect pass for Ramos to end it."
Arsenal 2-0 Olympiakos: Champions League – as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/oct/01/arsenal-v-olympiakos-champions-league-live,"Man of the match Martin Odegaard spoke to TNT: ““It was nice to be back. I have missed it and I felt good, and it was a good win. “That is what I want to do, especially with those forward players, especially with Viktor [Gyokeres] who is so aggressive and always a threat. That is my job, to create things for them. I could have had a few more assists, but we got the win and I enjoyed it.” That leaves Arsenal in a decent position after the second week. Here’s David Hytner’s report from the Emirates. Goalscorer Gabriel Martinelli spoke to TNT: “It was a great ball from Myles, we were talking about me attacking the space in the box before the game and he did great with the ball. I could have done better in that one.” “It’s good for the club, we want to have the best players around us and we have a really good group. We want to win every title that we play in and that is what we are going to try to do.” “We play for Arsenal and we want to win every single game of the season if possible and we want to win every trophy that we can.” That turned into a decent workout for Arsenal’s players after that Arteta team selection. Martin Odegaard purred, and Bukayo Saka completed the win for the Londoners. Arteta had to make the changes to see it out. Olympiakos were decent and are treated to some Greek music as they applaud their fans. 90+5 min: The Emirates has been tense but now those who haven’t dashed to the tube are singing loud. Two wins from two. We’ll see Max Dowman yet in this competition. But not here. 90+3 min: The result settled, let’s hear again from Russell Yong: “Not to turn this into a back-and-forth but, in response to Richard Moore, he seems to think I’m an Arsenal fan agitating for Nwaneri to play every game; I am neither. My point was merely to explain why the impatience exists among certain quarters. I think Arteta has been eminently sensible in the speed at which he has integrated Nwaneri and, as I said, there’s a lot of football to be played this season and he will certainly get his chances. But it’s a cliche that saying anything remotely positive or hopeful about a young player is to “pile pressure” on them. When the philosophy is “if you’re good enough, you’re old enough”, the difference between 18 and 19 is academic. At the end of the day, in a team like Arsenal’s, you’re either a trusted first-team player or not. We will know by season’s end.” Relief for Arsenal, pain for Tzolakis who lets the ball go through his legs. The supplier was Odegaard, the finish was from Saka, the Gunners old firm. 90+1 min: Saliba again does well to stop a ball aimed at El Kaabi. Strefezza has been booked, when it was his cross might have been much better. 90 min: Five minutes will be added on, five nervy minutes. 88 min: El Kaabi has a headed chance, the cross coming in from the right. Big Evangelos was up for that, he thought it was in but it was off Saliba…there’s a penalty check that’s not given. 87 min: Saka lashes it long for Gyokeres to run the channels and get penalised for handball. 85 min: Podence jabs the ball to Chiquinho, who forces a fine save from Raya. They have a corner, in front of their own fans. Gyokeres has to head clear. This has not been easy. 84 min: I was at this game, a famous comeback for Olympiakos. Could there be a late repeat? Their manager back then? Marco Silva. 82 min: So close for Arsenal. Great save from Tzolakis, and again, both efforts from Odegaard. Saka had set up those chances with his pass. 80 min: Danger from El Kaabi means there’s an Olympiakos corner. 78 min: Odegaard can still play his part, then. He has a job to do, as Olympiakos continue to look dangerous. 77 min: Arsenal have a free-kick, and it takes El Kaabi to clear it. Odegaard is still on the field, it was Trossard who was subbed. Meanwhile, Declan Rice is booked for a foul where he admits his guilt. 75 min: Gabriel has a knock, having pulled up when he and Raya were going for the same ball. On comes Christian Mosquera. Olympiakos change: Lorenzo Scipioni for Dani Garcia. 73 min: Big cheers for big players: on some Saka and Eze. Off go Martinelli and the excellent Odegaard, who had faded a tad. 71 min: This doesn’t feel like a Dowman/Nwanieri game. It’s too tense, and the opponent too dangerous. Dowman has until the sixth game of the groups to still be 15 and a Champions League player. 70 min: Richard Moore gets in touch: “It’s a while back on the Arsenal live report now, but Russell Yong’s point about Nwaneri is silly and irresponsible. There’s no sensible measure by which he’s been around for three seasons. He made a two minute substitute appearance when he was 15 in the 22/23 season, and another when he was 16 the following season. Last season was his first full season, then, and he played most of it before his 18th birthday this past March. Phil Foden didn’t have a comparable season until he 19/20, when he was mostly nineteen. Messi was also older than Nwaneri when he had his breakout season in 2005/06. “So let’s not pile pressure on Nwaneri by suggesting that he’s somehow underachieving because he’s not an Arsenal regular yet. Arteta still trusts him enough to have made him a first-half replacement for Odegaard against Leeds.” 69 min: Gyokeres loses the run of the ball, rather unfortunately, El Kaabi’s goal was offside by mere millimetres. 67 min: Oof! Olympiakos have the ball in the net, Dani Garcia’s flicked header is saved by Raya. El Kaabi taps in but there was an offside, and that’s confirmed via VAR. 66 min: The Gunners yet to shoot on target since scoring. Gyok has gone quiet, too. Eze is warming up… 64 min: Arteta is asking his team to push on. Instant response: Odegaard plays a beauty, Trossard cuts in, too many touches, and is blocked off. 62 min: Timber has to sweep up when Podence makes one of his scuttles down the flank. Olympiakos really are no mugs though nobody sensible would have suggested that. 61 min: Zubimendi is booked for fouling a speeding Martins who might have been away. That was a hauling back. Martins soon departs, as Mehdi Taremi, a fine player, at Inter last year, comes on. He’s a wily fox of a striker. 60 min: Lewis-Skelly takes a knock but Arsenal play on. Trossard takes on Costinha who is a doughty customer. Olympiakos to make changes soon. 59 min: Gabriel is booked for delaying the restart. Kari Tulinius gets in touch: “I’m not worried about Nwaneri. Last season, things didn’t seem to be clicking for PSG’s Senny Mayulu at first, but once he’d gotten used to the hurly-burly of senior football, it all clicked. The wealth of big clubs makes it tempting to solve every problem with money, but often it’s a matter of time and patience. Senny Mayulu just scored against Barcelona. Nwaneri looks like that sort of talent.” 58 min: Gunners subs: Merino off, Rice on. Ben White off, Jurrien Timber on. 56 min: Daniel Podence’s little legs carry him to the byline and his cross is dangerous. It’s ruled he had gone out of play but a replay suggests otherwise. 55 min: Arteta looks a tad tense. This wasn’t going to be easy as some suggested but increasingly heavy weather is being made. 53 min: Feel old yet? Trossard has another chance but smashes wide. Declan Rice is coming on. Merino is down after smashing into Tzolakis, the keeper. 51 min: Gyokeres sets up Trossard but the move doesn’t quite come off. The final ball has gone awry in recent moments. Number one in the UK when Max Dowman was born: the number one song in the UK on the week ending 31st December 2009 was the re-release of “Killing in the Name” by Rage Against the Machine. The anti Simon Cowell hit. On the U.S. Billboard charts around December 31, 2009, the top song was “Empire State of Mind” by Jay-Z featuring Alicia Keys Avatar was the number one film on both sides of the Atlantic. 49 min: Martins looks a good player and his ball to Chiquinho means Podence forces a corner. Noise in the Olympiakos corner but disappointment as it’s cleared. Applause for young Max Dowman as he runs the line in warming up. 47 min: Olympiakos start on the offensive, Lewis-Skelly asked to sweep up as a defender rather than sweep forward on the overlap. 46 min: At the Emirates, the players are back out. The atmosphere seems a tad quiet, though the Greek fans are making plenty of noise. Follow the latest with Michael Butler here. Latest scores in the Champions League 17:45 Qarabag 2-0 Copenhagen – FT Union Saint-Gilloise 0-4 Newcastle – FT 20:00 Arsenal 1-0 Olympiacos – HT Barcelona 1-1 Paris St-Germain – HT Bayer Leverkusen 0-0 PSV Eindhoven – HT Borussia Dortmund 1-0 Athletic Club – HT Monaco 1-2 Manchester City – HT Napoli 1-0 Sporting – HT Villarreal 1-0 Juventus – HT Just that Martinelli strikes divides two teams who looked more well matched as the game rolled on. Martin Odegaard has been superb, back to his best? Viktor Gyokeres has trundled with menace, now can he find his shooting boots? 45 min: Just two minutes added to a breathless, entertaining half. Martinelli tries to escape away but is stopped. Merino is down, as is Ortega of Olympiakos. Both quickly resume with the promise of half-time electrolytes. 44 min: El Kaabi falls in the Arsenal box…there’s a flag on the play from VAR but he went down too easily. No penalty given, nor was it deserved. 43 min: Peter Oh gets in touch: “What would self-styled Zeus Evangelos Marinakis do if Panathinaikos Olympiakos were to face Nottingham Forest in Europe? Blast thunderbolts from his eyes and fingers, and then instantly transport to the other side and block the bolts with his golden scepter?!” 41 min: More Gyokeres marauding, another fine Zubimendi pass, and he fires wide. One of these should come off soon. Next, Trossard blams over, set up by Martinelli and out. 39 min: Another chance, this time for Podence who swings and doesn’t make a proper connection. 37 min: Hello, another Olympiakos attack. Podence, the wee man, smashes in a cross and Ayoub El Kaabi nods wide. He’s the danger man. This is turning into a tough assignment. Or a dangerous one, at least. 35 min: More Odegaard skill, sends away Martinelli and corner as Ben White joins the throng. Arsenal have delighted with their passing. Much less rugby union mauling than we have become used to. The corner from Trossard is a beauty and a foul by Saliba on the keeper is ruled as Gabriel gets to it. 33 min: Ally McCoist has been thrilling to that pass from Odegaard and compared it to the ball distribution skills of the late, much missed Ray Wilkins. What a player he was, by the way. 31 min: Gyokeres is released by an Odegaard ball and goes on a bulwarking run, blasting through defenders, only to be blocked at the moment of truth. Martinelli was waiting for a pass that was never likely to come. 30 min: Arsenal’s early dominance seems a while back now. Olympiakos are chasing them down and have plenty to offer in attack. 28 min: Chiquinho’s free-kick is good, and there’s a Restos tries to get on the end of it. Arsenal clear their lines. 26 min: Mendilibar is booked for barracking from the sidelines. At the back of the posh seats, Evangelos Marinakis is looming, pacing up and down. 25 min: Ben White is given long throw duty. Merino attempts the spectacular but that is given as a foul for dangerous play. There was a brief penalty claim there. 23 min: Gyokeres is down, after running into an opposing defender. His hair is out of place but he will play on. 21 min: The Greek team look quite handy here, and have pushed on. Credit to them. 19 min: A spell of Olympiakos possession, and they show off their threat. Daniel Podence, once of Wolves, forces a fine save from Raya, who had stayed alert. Gelson Martins and Chiquinho look like decent technicians. 17 min: Russell Yong gets in touch: “I think focusing on Nwaneri detracts from the fact that any of Arsenal’s outfield bench could conceivably have a case for wondering why they’re not playing. Conversely, any of the starters would feel the same had they not started. It’s a mark of the depth they have, two-deep in every position, with yet more (Havertz, Madueke, Hincapie, Jesus) injured. There’s a lot of football to be played yet; they will surely all get their chances. “That said, I think there’s a difference between being unduly impatient about Nwaneri and good-faith pondering of his circumstances. He’s been around for three seasons and played a lot more last season, without ever quite giving the impression that he’s trusted to really cement his place in the team, the way Saka, Foden or Messi (to throw out three names of prodigious players who established themselves within three seasons) did. Even allowing for Arsenal’s depth now, it’s natural to hope he doesn’t turn out like, say, Smith Rowe. Peaked then regressed steadily until he drifted out of the team entirely.” Gyokeres meanwhile has a shot. He looks like he fancies filling his boots. 16 min: Olympiakos have their own Basque in the veteran Dani García, once of both Athletic and La Real. He’s played a couple of nice passes but Merino and Zubimendi are giving him the runaround. 14 min: Arsenal rewarded for their dominance and speed of attack. Gyokeres smashed through Costinha, and Martinelli is full of confidence at the moment. An opposition attack breaks down and Arsenal counter, Gyokeres goes away and sets up Martinelli for a goal he gets two bites of. 9 min: Jose Luis Mendilibar is the Olympiakos coach, and twice a winner of European trophies, the Europa League with Sevilla and the Conference League with his current club. Those were in consecutive years, too. NB: This was actually the last time the clubs met, during Covid, and with no crowd. Do such matches count? 8 min: Another Martinelli run, and he’s brought down by Ortega. Olympiakos are asking their opponents on. Tzolakis, the keeper, claims that free-kick with ease from Odegaard. 6 min: It’s all Arsenal. They are all over their opponents. Martinelli is out on the right with Trossard on the left. A winger using his right foot at right wing; it will never catch on. 4 min: Free-kick after a Costinha foul – not the Costinha of Porto legend – though he is a former Porto player. Saliba wins the header but it’s cleared well enough. 2 min: It should have been 1-0. Raya to Odegaard to Lewis-Skelly, and a fine cross. Martinelli’s header is actually off his shoulder. It was all started by Raya’s brilliant pass to set up a sweeping move. 1 min: Olympiakos get it underway but Arsenal soon enough take up possession. Ben White soon joins the attack as an overlapping full-back. Feels like it’s been a while. NB: Max Dowman *is* on the bench, and could become the youngest ever Champions League player. There’s just been a short memorial to poor Billy Vigar, the former Arsenal player who died last week. Charles Antaki gets in touch: “Yes, no rush. Arsenal fans remember starlets who looked terrific and got the pulses going, only for the sparkle to fade (Charlie Patino) or injuries to rub it out (Krystian Bielik), or just regression to the mean to take over (many, many others). Nwaneri and Dowman’s prospects will be all the firmer for being eased into it.” Bielik was a decent player for Birmingham and is now at West Brom. Patino is at Deportivo La Coruna, though sadly not a Diego Tristan, Djalminha and not the superb Juan Carlos Valeron quality of team. They’re in the Segunda. Olympiakos have another familiar face with them: Edu is alongside President Marinakis, as Ange Postecoglou, among others, terms him. Zach Neeley asks: “Why rotate so much but leave Nwaneri on the bench? In scientific terms, he is very good.” I suppose Arteta is being careful. Which means Max Dowman fans may have to wait a while yet. Mikel Arteta spoke to the media at a pre-match news conference at the Emirates on Tuesday. “We have the same ambition - to go game by game and try to be better than the opponent, which is very difficult in this competition. We want to win as many games as we can. Tomorrow is going to be a really difficult one. We know how important the home form is going to be to reach the phase we want to.” “What I want with this football club is to win major trophies. Nobody else has to put that line to us. That’s the ambition. Excuses have never been a part of my life.” Will Arsenal get caught out by those changes? As Jonathan Wilson points out, they have flaws. Arsenal have over the past couple of seasons become a side with a tendency to get down on themselves, to react badly to misfortune or adversity; that happened to an extent at St James’ as early momentum was lost, but they still had enough to claim the win. Certainly the table looks – and the mood feels – very different now to how it would have done without the late goals in their last two games. Big words from Arsenal’s key defender: “I cannot leave this club without giving them something back. I’ve won nothing so my first choice was to stay here and win everything first. Every year we’re getting better. This year, we had a lot of experiences from the last three seasons. We know that we’re always close, always close. Now we know how the Premier League is. We know how the Champions League is. “So we have to stop talking and prove on the pitch that we have to win. Of course, it’s good to talk, but now we have to prove it on the pitch that we are ready to win. Mikel Arteta has seriously rotated his Arsenal team, Buyako Saka and Eberechi Eze benched. Ben White and Myles-Lewis Skelly at full-back, Mikel Merino, the goal machine, in midfield with fellow Basque Martin Zubimendi. Gabriel Martinelli – “the finisher” – is a starter. Leandro Trossard gets played a lot these days. Jurrien Timber, Riccardo Calafiori and Declan Rice Arsenal: Raya, White, Saliba, Gabriel, Lewis-Skelly, Zubimendi, Merino, Odegaard, Trossard, Martinelli, Gyokeres. Subs: Arrizabalaga, Setford, Mosquera, Saka, Eze, Timber, Norgaard, Nwaneri, Calafiori, Rice, Dowman Olympiacos starting XI: Tzolakis, Ortega, Pirola, El Kaabi, Gelson Martins, Dani Garcia, Costinha, Chiquinho, Hezze, Restos, Podence. Subs: Paschalakis, Kouraklis, Biancone, Kalogeropoulos, Sciponi, Strefezza, Onyemaechi, Pnevmonidis, Mouzakitis, Taremi That last meeting was five long years ago. It was followed by a panic we’d all rather forget. The games are coming thick and fast for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. How will they react to that late win at Newcastle, where a great deal of psychic energy was expended. The aim in the expanded group stage is to get the job done fast, and follow up last time’s defeat of Athletic Club to make it two wins from two. Olympiakos are a familiar adversary. The two have met 12 times, winning six each. They also have a familiar owner in the figure of Evangelos Marinakis. Kick-off: 8pm UK time. Join me."
"Barcelona 1-2 PSG, Monaco 2-2 Manchester City and more: Champions League and Championship – as it happened",https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/oct/01/barcelona-v-psg-monaco-v-manchester-city-and-more-champions-league-and-championship-live,"That’s all from me. Here are our initial match reports. We will also have something on Barcelona 1-2 PSG. Keep an eye out for that. Thank you for reading and for your emails. Until next time! Here is some reaction from Liverpool’s defeat at Galatasaray on Tuesday night. Erling Haaland speaks to the cameras. He has a face of thunder as he speaks to the reporter. Of course, I don’t feel good. We didn’t play well. We need more energy. We dominated in the first half, but not the second. It’s not good enough. On his lack of touches: I still think I’m involved, doing movements, creating space for others. But I didn’t play well in the second half, I didn’t score. Here is the table for the league phase of Champions League. We are only a quarter of the way through, a long way to go. Qarabag have two wins from two, though! Here is what those four Championship results have done to the table. Coventry are two off leaders Middlesbrough. In case you are catching up on Newcastle’s result: they played Union Saint Gilloise in the early kick-off and were thoroughly impressive. Meanwhile, at the Emirates. “Young Rasmus Højlund with a lovely brace tonight. Antony similarly got a goal &amp; an assist last week in the Europa League against Forest,” emails Steven Grundy. “I hope that, one day, our Prime Minister orders a full enquiry into Manchester United in order to understand how this great weeping ghost ship was able to wreck so many careers.” Some initial thoughts! What a win for PSG! Monaco were well worth their draw with Manchester City, although Tijjani Reijnders did hit the bar for the visitors. Rasmus Højlund, two goals for the Napoli striker on loan from Manchester United (and two assists from Kevin De Bruyne). Coventry City are good at football, pass it on. PSG have won it at the death! Barcelona play a suicidally high line and they are punished! Hakimi runs from deep to break the offside trap, canters down the right and curls a brilliant, low cross to Ramos. The Portuguese striker sidefoots past Szczesny – PSG have surely won the game in Catalonia. Hansi Flick, the Barcelona manager, is absolutely furious on the sideline, although it looks like it is with his own team! Another brilliant game! Villarreal have found an equaliser, with Renato Veiga scoring direct from a corner. Dier sends Donnarumma the wrong way! Monaco are level! Eric Dier has taken a whack to the face in City’s box. Initially, nothing is awarded but the referee is called by VAR to the monitor. It is bedlam on the sidelines with the referee sending off two on the team benches, while Bernardo Silva is also given a yellow card for dissent, but the penalty is finally awarded! Guirassy surely makes things safe for Dortmund, inadvertently diverting Sabitzer’s shot into the net. A very lucky goal, but Dortmund won’t care. “Too right Rashford should be England’s left winger, but only if Thomas Tuchel believes in him,” emails Rick Harris. “Marcus needs to have a manager 100% behind him which he never had with Southgate, or Ten Hag or Amorim. Now at Barcelona Flick knows he has a special player on his hands and now Rashford is getting regular starts and decent game time when he is on the bench you are seeing the real player re-emerge.” Three out of four matches have now finished. Millwall 0-4 Coventry Norwich 0-1 West Brom Portsmouth 2-2 Watford QPR v Oxford United is still goalless with 86 minutes played. Højlund with his second of the game, and De Bruyne’s second assist! I mentioned this pairing before the game and the two combine for another brilliant goal. De Bruyne whips a trademark cross into the ‘Corridor of Uncertainty’ and Højlund is super brave in winning a header, beating Sporting keeper Rui Silva to the punch. Segecic has been so impressive for Pompey since his move from the A-League and the Australian has equalised for the home side, ending a scrappy move with a fierce drive which caught Selvik cold at the near post! Potentially a very big goal down at the bottom of the Championship. Ellis Simms gave Coventry a 3-0 lead after pouncing on a rebound off the bar, while Kaine Kesler-Hayden’s deflected finish – his first for Cov following his £3.5m move from Aston Villa – has made it 4-0! Frank Lampard is doing an amazing job with the Sky Blues. Two quick-fire goals to tell you about in Germany. It was the home side that took the lead through teenager Kofane after a dismal defensive mix up. But PSV have just drawn level through Saibari, who has curled a beautiful finish into the far corner. “Noteworthy that a number of British players are playing prominent roles for non-British teams across tonight’s matches,” emails Edward Ricketts. “Burgess, Jobe Bellingham, McTominay, Rashford, Dier - looks like a greater adventurousness these days in players finding opportunities abroad, or was this always the case (obviously we’re not talking of a mass exodus here)? And Carney Chukwuemeka!” Rashford is playing out of his skin for Barcelona. He has just nutmegged Warren Zaïre-Emery and put Barcola on his arse. Rashford is frightening when he wants to be. There is increasingly an argument that he should be England’s left winger. Politano dangles a clumsy leg, Maximiliano Araújo took a tumble in the box and from the penalty spot, Sporting half-time sub Luis Suárez sent the 6ft7in Milinkovic-Savic the wrong way from 12 yards. A terrible mix-up between Waldemar Anton and Niklas Süle gives Gorka Guruzeta an easy finish from just six yards out! Athletic Club are back in this! Game on! One-nil down at half-time, Juventus now lead! Parejo, who normally never gives the ball away, gifts possession to Francisco Conceição and the Portuguese drives straight through the middle of Villarreal before finishes past Tenas. Great goal! A correction! A described Rocco Vata as a ‘Scot’ earlier. He is a Republic of Ireland international! “Despite Rocco Vata being the son of former Albanian captain Rudi Vata and being born and raised in Scotland with an Scottish mother, he is actually an Irish international,” emails John Brennan. “We are a little sensitive about this kind of stuff considering our experiences with other players who are qualified for more than one nation.” This is probably not a good time to tell you that Declan Rice has just come on for Arsenal. Coventry score their 20th goal of the season from the penalty spot. Haji Wright scoring from 12 yards, his second of the game and eighth of the season. The USMNT striker is on fire. An email from Colum Fordham: “Here in Naples, the focus, strangely, is on Napoli-Benfica at the Maradona. De Bruyne got a lot of stick for his performance against Inter on Sunday, despite a well-taken penalty and some insidious corners. But I was delighted to seem him ride off a tackle or two and dribble through three Sporting Lisbon players to set up a great finish from another former Man Utd reject Hojlund who has suddenly turned into a star forward.” Somebody sound the Bicycle Kick Klaxon! PLEASE SOMEONE SOUND THE JUVENTUS-BICYCLE-KICK KLAXON! Up from the back, centre-back Federico Gatti has improvised brilliantly in reacting to a near-post flick on, scissor-kicking a finish into the corner. Arnau Tenas should probably do better in the Villarreal but take nothing away from Gatti, that was a sensational strike. There is a quick check by VAR for dangerous play, with Gatti swiping his bicycle kick around head height, but the goal stands! Former Chelsea midfielder Chukwuemeka gets his first Champions League goal, squeezing in a left-footed finish just inside the near post. Keeper (Unai Simón, of all people!) should not be beaten there, etc, so on. Watford has turned this around completely! Rocco Vata has only been on since half-time but now he has a goal to go with his assist! It’s an ugly goal in truth, bundling home a rebound, but the Scot won’t care one bit! We’re back underway in all the 8pm BST kick-offs. I’m fairly sure the only goal I have missed in my commentary is Watford’s equaliser at Portsmouth. That was scored by Imran Louza after good work from former Celtic winger Rocco Vata down the left. It’s 1-1 there and that game has just kicked off for the second half. Millwall 0-1 Coventry and Norwich 0-1 West Brom all has resumed. Haaland has barely had a kick, yet he has scored two superb goals. This one is even better than his first: Nico O’Reilly lofts a hopeful cross into the box with no pace, but Haaland completely bullies his marker (former Southampton defender Mohammed Salisu, who is no pushover) and powerfully nods a header into the corner. How on earth did he create that much power from such a weak cross?! Vintage centre-forward play. The sort of goal Dixie Dean would be proud of. We spoke about the Højlund-De Bruyne link up, and the two have combined brilliantly for Napoli’s opening goal! From the edge of their own area, Napoli pounce: De Bruyne rolling back the years, powerfully gliding past two before laying on an inch-perfect through ball. Højlund shows great pace to latch onto the ball, and nutmegs Rui Silva with the finish. Diego Armando Maradona Stadium erupts! Mayulu equalises for PSG in Barcelona! This is all down to Nuno Mendes, surely the best left-back on the planet, who streams clear of Koundé down PSG’s left. Nuno Mendes checks, and picks a perfect pass to Mayulu, who beats Cubarsí to the ball, takes a touch and finishes with aplomb past Szczesny. Great finish from the teenager! Monaco 1-1 Manchester City 30 min: With his weaker right foot, Phil Foden has rattled the underside of the bar for City, who are pushing to take the lead again. The ball bounced just the wrong side of the goalline, from City’s perspective. A word, please, for Dortmund’s kits this season. The home has a retro feel, somewhere between their 90s kits and the Manchester United 2000s home shirt, which might have something to do with the Vodafone sponsor. The away kit, which Dortmund played in at the weekend, is also delicious. Adeyemi has been ridiculously good this season and he pops up with another assist here, using his pace to zoom past his marker and cross to Svensson at the back stick. The Swede makes no mistake. Re the crowd at Monaco, another problem I believe is that they have ripped some seats out because they are finally going to make the ground red and white. This means that two big sections are closed. Coventry are absolutely flying under Frank Lampard. The Sky Blues are the top scorers in the Championship this season by a distance and now have their 19th goal of the season through Haji Wright, who has seven of his own, tapping in at the back post after good work by Brandon Thomas-Asante. For context, the next biggest scorers in the Championship are Bristol City, who have five fewer with 14. After Vitinha gives the ball away in midfield, PSG are punished! It’s a brilliant, sweeping counter attack. Lamine Yamal feeding Pedri, Pedri feeding Rashford on the left and an brilliant, incisive pass to the back post, where Ferran Torres slides in and sidefoots a finish past Chevalier. Monaco draw level after Teze bends a pearler into the top corner from 25 yards out! It had to be some shot to beat Donnarumma from there, and it was! The Georgian, who was so good at Euro 2024, gives the Yellow Submarine the lead! Parejo, who is still doing bits in 2025, threads a through ball through to Mikautadze. There is an initial tackle, but Pépé is there in support and he squares the ball to Mikautadze again, who makes no mistake from eight yards. Gvardiol steps into midfield, has time to pick a pass and floats a perfect pass into the path of Haaland. It’s an awkward bouncing ball for the striker, but no matter. The Norwegian simply lifts it over Kohn and into the net. That looked so easy, but that was an elite finish. And despite 15 minutes being played, that was Haaland’s first touch! There’s been a goal at Arsenal, but I’ll let John Brewin tell you all about that in our dedicated liveblog. After Samuel Iling-Junior made a great dash to the byline down the right, his cutback causes chaos in the box, pinballing around before Josh Maja pings a shot into the bottom corner from around the penalty spot. Julien Laurens, a French pundit on TNT Sport, has just been asked about why the stands are so empty at Monaco’s stadium, Stade Louis II. He claims that only 4,000 people live in Monaco during winter, so that goes some way to explaining why the team struggle so much with attracting fans. Four thousand! Bayer Leverkusen 0-0 PSV – goal disallowed for PSV! 5 min: Ivan Perisic ghosted in at the back post for PSV and nodded past Mark Flekken, but the Croatian was just adjudged to be offside. Replays show he was half a yard off. Barcelona 0-0 PSG 3 min: Lamine Yamal, in his first start for Barcelona since August, has just doing a perfect Zidane turn/roulette to skip away from two PSG markers. Absolutely outrageous skill. Six Champions League games and one Championship match are (also) underway! In what already feels like a big match between two sides likely to fight it out at the bottom of the Championship table, Tottenham loanee Yang Min-hyeok has opened the scoring for Pompey! After a long throw was launched into the box, the ball broke loose and Yang leathered it into the far corner from around just inside the 18-yard box. Nice finish. Three of the Championship matches are 7.45pm GMT kick-offs: Millwall v Coventry, Norwich v West Brom and Portsmouth v Watford. Unhelpfully, QPR v Oxford United is a 8pm kick-off. This is the league table, as things stand before kick-off. Speaking of Newcastle United, they have just wrapped up a comprehensive 4-0 win over Union Saint-Gilloise. Away victories in the Champions League are not easy over any opponent – just as Spurs and Liverpool – but that will be a massive boost for Newcastle after their opening defeat to Barcelona. And it will do wonders for their goal difference, which is very important in the league phase. Remember Manchester City, Sporting and Club Brugge only qualified for the knockout play-off on goal difference. Very interesting that Robert Lewandowski has been left on the Barcelona bench to face PSG – particularly because he has scored twice in La Liga in the last week, including the winner over Real Sociedad on Sunday. Hansi Flick has preferred Ferran Torres and Marcus Rashford preferred – the latter, of course, scored both goals for Barça in their Champions League opener at Newcastle, a 2-1 win. If you are wondering why Paul Pogba isn’t in the Monaco squad to face City, it’s because he is still building up his fitness since his summer move. Monaco’s club’s general director, Thiago Scuro said in July that they “expect a three-month process” in terms of getting fit, and that seems to be on track. This week, prior to City’s visit, Monaco manager Adi Hütter confirmed the club were “following his plan. We expected him maybe for the game against Nice [on Sunday] in the squad, but I think we have to postpone it for the game against Angers [on 18 October] maybe. “At the moment he’s doing more of the warming up, and also in small-sided games. Now he’s increasing a lot, he’s doing well at the moment, and I hope after the national team break he can be a part of the squad.” Here’s a bit of background to Pogba’s move to Monaco, in case you are catching up. It is a warm night in Monaco, a place Pep Guardiola does not remember fondly from his first Champions League campaign as Manchester City head coach. It was the Ligue 1 side that ended that European tour. Monaco had a team including Kylian Mbappé, Bernardo Silva and Fabinho, to name a few. The current crop of Monaco stars are far less bright and Adi Hutter’s problems are exacerbated by an array of injury problems, which means the midfield is down to its bare bones. After beating Napoli in their opening fixture, Guardiola will see this as the perfect chance to double their point count and make an important step towards qualifying for the knockout stages. John Stones is brought into the team at right-back as the continuous rotation in that position keeps the rest of the defence and goalkeeper interested. After a disappointing European campaign last time, Guardiola cannot afford any slip ups. Considering the gap in quality between the two starting lineups, anything other than a City win would be a huge shock. Imagine being Rasmus Højlund right now. Rather than warming the Manchester United bench, reeling from another defeat at Brentford and wincing at the thought of facing Sunderland this weekend, he is living in Naples, starting in the Champions League with Kevin De Bruyne on hand to provide assists. Oh, and he’s still earning that Premier League coin. Oooof. Monaco v Manchester City Monaco: Kohn, Kehrer, Dier, Salisu, Vanderson, Teze, Coulibaly, Diatta, Akliouche, Fati, Balogun.

Who says you can’t have a clockwatch that straddles both Europe’s finest club competition … and the Champions League. Boom, boom! We’ll be here all night (or around 11pm BST) with that sort of hollow humour. Come on in, the water is lukewarm. That’s right, as well as four Championship fixtures, there is the small matter of Barcelona v PSG, Monaco v Manchester City and much, much more. Here is the full list of games we will be attempting to cover, although it should probably be flagged not equally. Not all matches are created as such. We’ll have the team news shortly. But while you wait, please get stuck into these other liveblogs. Newcastle, playing in the earlier kick-off, are winning in Belgium. And we have a dedicated liveblog to Arsenal v Olympiakos (8pm BST kick-off), which you can see right here."
Martinelli and Saka on the money as Arsenal sweep Olympiakos aside,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/01/arsenal-olympiakos-champions-league-match-report,"They like to talk about invincibility in this part of north London and it remains the only way to describe Mikel Arteta’s record with Arsenal in European group‑phase games at the Emirates Stadium. It is now eight wins out of eight in the Champions League with zero goals conceded. And if you add in the Europa League from earlier in his tenure, it is 14 victories out of 14 with two goals against. Olympiakos pitched up with a remarkable statistic of their own. They had won on their past three visits to this ground, the most recent two coming in the knockout rounds of the Europa League, even if the second in 2020-21 did not prevent an aggregate defeat. The first was in a Champions League group‑stage match in 2015-16. Nobody expected anything other than another Arsenal success, the latest demonstration of the power and depth that Arteta has at his disposal despite this being a decent Olympiakos vintage. It was nervier than the home crowd would have liked in the closing stages, the visitors pushing and making for a couple of scares. This Arsenal team is not easily breached. We are into October and still they have let in only three goals in all competitions – one of them from open play. Gabriel Martinelli scored in the 12th minute and although Olympiakos had their moments they could not find a way past David Raya. Arsenal were wasteful in the final third. Martinelli was guilty and so were Arteta’s other starters in the front line – Viktor Gyökeres and Leandro Trossard. But when Bukayo Saka, on as a substitute, took a pass from the excellent Martin Ødegaard to jam a shot through the legs of the Olympiakos goalkeeper, Kostas Tzolakis, in stoppage time, it was over. Arsenal have built on the 2-0 win at Athletic Bilbao in their Champions League opener. Nights such as this only add extra layers to their reputation. Arsenal had to go back to November 2019 for the previous time they had failed to win a group match at this stadium in Europe; it was the defeat against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League, which led to the sacking of Unai Emery, the caretaker hire of Freddie Ljungberg and the arrival of Arteta, whose first European assignment was against Olympiakos in the last 32 of the competition that season. It ended in a last-gasp extra‑time defeat here and an away‑goals exit. Of the numerous eye-catching lines around this encounter, many were linked to the past. When had Arsenal previously conceded a goal in a European group game on their own turf? It was against Rapid Vienna in the 4-1 Europa League win in December 2020. Ødegaard was in the mood from the first whistle, bringing the urgency on the ball; the incision. The captain sparked an early move that ended with Martinelli somehow glancing a Myles Lewis-Skelly cross off target; Martinelli was all alone in front of goal. It seemed to come off his shoulder. No matter. It was not long before Arsenal led and it was Martinelli with the tap-in from a tight angle after Gyökeres saw Tzolakis deflect his shot against a post. Ødegaard had played the pass to Gyökeres and it was all about the striker’s strength; he bulldozed in between two defenders to make it happen. It was Martinelli on his less favoured right flank; Trossard on the left. And Martinelli simply had to play in his teammate on 21 minutes when Arsenal broke with two against one. Instead, he tried to out-run the last man and could not get around him. Arsenal ought to have had more before the interval. Gyökeres ignored a square pass for Martinelli after an Ødegaard through ball and shot at Tzolakis while Gabriel Magalhães went close after an Ødegaard corner. Gyökeres swiped another chance high after a lovely Trossard ball. Olympiakos came to play. Ayoub El Kaabi looped a header too close to Raya just before Martinelli’s goal and their big chance of the first half came in the 32nd minute when Daniel Podence caught a volley so sweetly from Santiago Hezze’s cross. Raya tipped over – an outstanding reflex save. The mood was different in the second half. It was not the handbrake from Arteta but his idea seemed to be containment. Arsenal changed down through the gears. Trossard blew a couple of chances and there was anxiety in the home seats; cries for their players to wake up as they survived an Olympiakos thrust on 66 minutes. Podence’s cross was made to measure for El Kaabi, whose header was well saved by Raya. The striker poked home on the rebound but the offside flag had gone up against him. Arteta, who would withdraw Gabriel Magalhães as a precaution against injury, saw Tzolakis deny Ødegaard; he should not have been able to make the save. Olympiakos retained hope. Saka snuffed it out."
Late Dier penalty for Monaco pegs back Manchester City after Haaland double,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/01/monaco-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report,"It had been a subdued night in Monaco, with Manchester City sleepwalking to victory until Nico González kicked Eric Dier in the face in a failed attempt to defend a free-kick. Chaos ensued with a melee as City lost their cool and the chance of a perfect Champions League start, before Dier calmly slotted home a last-minute penalty. City have only themselves to blame for not finishing off a stubborn Monaco off earlier. Erling Haaland proved there was such a thing as a sure bet as he increased his club tally to 11 goals in eight games, only to have his work undone by two incidents of poor defending. First, Jordan Teze was allowed too much space on the edge of the box, as he curled the first equaliser into the top corner and the foul for the penalty was at best naive. For González to raise his leg so high when defending a set piece was ill-judged, even if he made contact with the ball, with opponents buzzing around. Dier’s nose took the force of the Spaniard’s shinpad but it was worth the pain as Monaco got a point. The anger City showed when it was clear the incident was being reviewed would have been better used when the ball was in play. Gianluigi Donnarumma took the ball while the referee, Jesús Gil Manzano, jogged towards the pitchside monitor. The City goalkeeper was joined by Monaco players and Rúben Dias got in the middle of the matter before the backroom staff and teammates got involved. A Monaco coach was sent off, delaying the referee finally pointing to the spot. Dier was one of few to not relinquish their calm and did the rest. City should have finished the contest far earlier, enjoying 18 shots, but got only six on target. They enjoyed almost three-quarters of the possession but were unable to find a third goal, hindered by Monaco’s low block and a slow tempo. Equally, they had shown defensive vulnerability throughout the match, allowing Monaco more opportunities than their limited attacking intent merited. The Stade Louis II provides a tepid atmosphere and there was little in the opening skirmishes to suggest the crowd would be awoken by anything happening on the pitch. City were quiet in the opening quarter of an hour, doing their best to build attacks without finding a spark. City, however, are packed with quality players who have the ability to change things in a split second. On this occasion it was Josko Gvardiol’s turn to provide the dynamism, clipping a ball over the Monaco centre-backs for Haaland to reach, stretching his legs to flick over the onrushing Philipp Köhn with his first touch of the match. If this was supposed to be the beginning of the procession, Monaco were not willing victims, despite missing several key players. Folarin Balogun immediately missed a fine chance to equalise when he could not make contact with a header. He was relieved moments later thanks to lazy midfield play for City, who allowed Teze, a defender pushed into central midfield, too much time on the edge of the box. He picked his spot in the top corner and executed the shot perfectly to level three minutes after the opener. When Vanderson left the pitch in tears after becoming the latest Monaco player to succumb to injury, City took advantage of the rejig. Tijjani Reijnders went close with a low drive from the edge of the box, Bernardo Silva’s looping header to the back post was unfortunate to not find a teammate to finish off the move and Phil Foden sent a further warning by crashing a shot off the bar. Moments after missing a fine chance to retake the lead, Haaland made amends by leaping to head a Nico O’Reilly cross precisely into the corner. It was a deserved second, giving them a platform to build on. The performance epitomised Haaland, scoring twice after seven touches to bring up 52 goals in 50 Champions League matches. With Monaco operating in the lowest of blocks, it was imperative that the Norwegian was clinical when the chances arose, aided with his physical attributes. Without his strength, he would have not reached the pass for the opener nor jumped a height Mondo Duplantis would be proud of for the second. For all the control, City remained vulnerable at the back. Balogun again missed a superb chance to bring parity when he found himself unmarked at the back post; he could not provide the quality Haaland does, to City’s relief. Soon after that, Krépin Diatta should have done better after catching O’Reilly daydreaming and Maghnes Akliouche forced Donnarumma into a smart save to his right. It felt as if a third was required for City to be comfortable in the latter stages but it never came. There will be plenty of debate about the referee’s decision but City will be irritated by their failings when victory was there for the taking, while Dier and Monaco worked hard for their little bit of late fortune."
Crystal Palace embark on European quest as Glasner plots path to Leipzig,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/01/crystal-palace-conference-league-preview-oliver-glasner-dynamo-kyiv,"Crystal Palace supporters may have waited a lifetime for this moment but, for Oliver Glasner, it’s business as usual. After winning the FA Cup and Community Shield – the first major silverware in the club’s history – the Austrian manager who arrived in south London 18 months ago promising he was “no David Copperfield” is preparing his next trick: guiding Palace to the Conference League final next May. Having been demoted from the Europa League after Uefa deemed Palace part of a multi-club network, Glasner’s side edged past Fredrikstad in the qualifying round and the road to Leipzig starts for real against Dynamo Kyiv in Poland on Thursday evening. It is a fixture that has been greatly anticipated by 3,500 travelling fans, with an extra 900 tickets quickly snapped up for the match at Lublin Arena, which has hosted the Ukrainian side’s home matches in Europe since Russia’s invasion in 2022. Glasner has been keen to play down the significance of Palace’s astonishing 18-match unbeaten run since losing 5-0 to Newcastle in April, stressing after the thrilling late victory over Liverpool on Saturday that “we’re still in September, so there’s nothing more to say”. Yet with his team boasting the longest sequence without defeat in all of Europe’s top five leagues by some distance, ahead of Barcelona and Bayern Munich, it is not an achievement to be sniffed at. The captain, Marc Guéhi, gave an insight into the belief coursing through the Palace squad at the moment. “In terms of mentality, yes for sure it’s there,” said Guéhi, who did not want to comment on his failed £35m move to Liverpool on deadline day other than to thank Palace fans for their continued support. “We’ve tasted success but we’re definitely not satisfied and we do want more. Every single person at the football club strives for more – from the manager all the way down to the players. We’ve seen what we can do. There’s no saying that if we keep our heads down, hopefully we can have many more opportunities. Many more chances to do even greater things.” Asked what Glasner’s impact has been, he added: “If he wasn’t there on the sidelines, I think we’d all know what to do. There’s one thing that he mentions all the time: it’s not what we do, but it’s how we do it. I think the approach of anything that we do is really, really important. Going down to the pitch, with that mindset that we were talking about, that mentality, and if we approach things that way, it always helps us and keeps us in good stead.” The problem for Glasner is that the majority of his first XI has played almost every minute of a busy campaign so far, with Guéhi and Maxence Lacroix, Daniel Muñoz and Jean-Philippe Mateta having already racked up 10 club appearances by the end of September. Against a Dynamo Kyiv team who have plenty of pedigree in European competition over the years, and won their first league title since the war broke out last season under Oleksandr Shovkovskyi, the former goalkeeper who won 92 caps for Ukraine, Glasner is expected to take no chances and select a strong lineup. “We always play the best available team,” said Glasner. “We reward the good performance, because everybody who played, but also the players who came on in the last games, deserve to start, and that’s the best for a manager. We have many players who deserve to start, because they are in very good shape.” This competition is also uncharted territory for Glasner, who would have fancied his chances of repeating his 2022 success with Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League if Uefa hadn’t had other ideas. Yet Palace are rated as the bookmakers’ favourites to follow in the footsteps of West Ham and Chelsea by becoming the third London club to win the trophy that was introduced in 2021. Glasner acknowledged Palace could face a different challenge against sides who sit deep. “We have the skills to break this block on the other side,” he said. “You could see yesterday in the Champions League, Liverpool struck out to score in Istanbul and even Chelsea against Benfica, they’re both in close to 70% possession. But that doesn’t mean you score four or five goals. But we think we have the skills to score goals, independent of how Dynamo Kyiv will play.”"
Union Saint-Gilloise 0-4 Newcastle United: Champions League – as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/oct/01/union-saint-gilloise-v-newcastle-champions-league-live,"No post-match interviews, with the television stations haring off to other matches. But never mind that anyway, because Louise Taylor’s match report is in. And here it is! Thanks for reading this MBM. That was a seriously impressive performance by Newcastle United. Nick Woltemade opened the scoring with a flick so cute Uefa couldn’t confirm he’d scored it for ten minutes; the Toon Army historically love a striker, and the big man’s already won them over. Anthony Elanga was another seriously impressive new-boy. But man of the match was surely Anthony Gordon, who converted two penalties and was the relentless beating heart of most of what Newcastle did well. And they did a lot very well. A good evening at the office for Eddie Howe’s side, who get their Champions League totaliser turning, and put on a confident show that should get their Premier League campaign back on track sooner rather than later. Nottingham Forest next in the league, Benfica next in the European Cup, both at home. The season starts here! Newcastle put their first three Champions League points up on the board … and in some style! It’s their biggest-ever victory in the tournament proper. 90 min +3: Boufal has the opportunity for another whack from long range, but holds onto the ball too long and is eventually dispossessed. 90 min +2: Patris crosses from the right. Giger tries to back-flick home from ten yards, but no Woltemade he. Pope gathers without fuss. 90 min +1: The first minute of four added passes by without incident. “Gotta admit that Gordon has been central to most of the best things we’ve done tonight,” writes Chris Paraskevas. “I give him flak for his disciplinary record but he’s consistently good for us in Europe. Sometimes I think he’s better suited to the different pace of the continental game, than the EPL? He loves checking back in, dropping into deeper pockets of space and working over defenders. Also seems to be an excellent tactical thinker (when he’s not getting sent off).” 90 min: Hall one-twos with Barnes down the left. He cuts back for Tonali, whose first-time flipper-whip would sail into the top-left corner were it not for Scherpen’s reaction save. Nothing comes of the resulting corner. 88 min: USG’s search for that consolation looks futile. Newcastle pass it around the back as the clock runs down. 86 min: USG probe in the hope of a consolation. Niang makes good down the left but his eventual cross flies over everyone’s head. 84 min: That’s Trippier’s last act of the evening. He’s replaced by Schar. When the game restarts, Gordon goes on an electric run down the left and crosses, but there’s nobody there to tap home. Gordon has been excellent tonight. 83 min: A simple long pass down the right nearly undoes Newcastle. Patris races after it and bundles a bouncing ball across the face of goal. Nobody in black and white reacts, until Trippier finally turns up and pings behind for a corner, before anyone in yellow can catch up. Nothing comes of the set piece. … Gordon robs Boufal on the edge of the box. He sets his side off on the counter. Osula powers down the middle before rolling an exquisitely weighted ball down the inside-left channel for Barnes, who opens his body and flicks over Scherpen into the bottom left. What a glorious counter-attack! 80 min: Boufal finds himself in a large pocket of space, centrally, 25 yards out. He creams a shot towards the bottom-left corner, but Pope tips around the post with strong hands. And from the corner … 79 min: Nothing comes of the corner. 78 min: Barnes jinks in from the right and offloads to Gordon, who finds him with a cute return down the channel. Barnes enters the box and wins a corner, but before it can be taken, Patris comes on for Khalaili. 76 min: Gordon slips Hall into space down the left. Hall’s got Barnes in acres on the edge of the box, coming in from the right, but doesn’t spot him. He tries to return the ball to Gordon on the overlap and the move is rendered jiggered. 74 min: Boufal, formerly of Southampton, comes on for Rodriguez. 73 min: A triple sub by Newcastle. Woltemade, Elanga and Guimarães are replaced by Barnes, Hall and Osula. Woltemade has clearly announced himself as the Toon Army’s new hero, but Elanga impressed tonight as well. He’s in too, you’d think. 72 min: Now it’s Newcastle’s turn to stroke it around patiently. But the clock is their friend. 70 min: … and so having said that, Ait El Hadj advances down the inside-left channel and nearly whistles a curler into the top-right corner. Just over, and Pope probably had it covered. But still. It’s something. 69 min: USG ping it around the back comfortably enough, but then they’re three goals down, and Newcastle are quite happy to let them do it. They’re going nowhere. 67 min: USG make a double change. Rasmussen and Skyes come on for Mac Allister and Van De Perre. Not a great week in the Champions League for the Mac Allister clan. Skyes, formerly of Accrington Stanley and Southport, grew up as a Newcastle supporter. 66 min: Newcastle have been excellent tonight. The scoreline genuinely doesn’t flatter them. This is the sort of performance that will kick-start their season. “While my natural inclination as a Stuttgart fan is to cheer anything that makes Bayern Munich unhappy, I can’t help but feel sad,” writes Kári Tulinius. “The last couple of seasons have been the best the Boys from Cannstatt have had in over a decade. First we lost Guirassy, and then Woltemade. Newcastle have an absolute gem, damn them.” Gordon goes the same way, to the right. Scherpen guesses correctly, but Gordon has tucked it away into the bottom corner. What a dispatch! What a cross that earned the spot kick, as well. 63 min: Gordon’s cross reared up and hit Leysen on the arm as the defender was grappling with Woltemade, so the referee points to the spot. 62 min: Gordon crosses long from the left. Leysen hooks clear, but Woltemade claims a penalty. Play goes on, but eventually the referee stops it, and goes over to the monitor. A decision to be made here. 60 min: USG are racking up the bookings. Giger becomes yellow card number four for the hosts, as he slides into Tonali late. 59 min: Joelinton, who has taken a couple of knocks tonight, but hopefully nothing serious, is replaced by Miley. He doesn’t look in too much discomfort as he walks off. 58 min: Tonali swings it to the far stick, and that’s the easiest of claims for Scherpen in the USG goal. Not sure if that was intended as a cross or shot towards the top-right corner. 57 min: Mac Allister is booked for cynically skittling Gordon out on the left. A free kick in a dangerous area. Tonali to take. 56 min: Khalaili spins Burn with ease down the right. He’s eventually crowded off the ball, but USG are clearly targeting Burn here. Khalaili has seen a lot of the ball since the restart. 54 min: … and indeed he is. When the game restarts, Zorgane tries to find Khalaili down the right, but overcooks the pass, and Burn can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. 53 min: Guimarães is back up. He’d taken a whack on the foot in a 50-50 with Van De Perre. Looks like he’ll be fine to continue. 52 min: Guimaraes is down and requires some treatment. On comes the physio. 51 min: Burgess is booked for cynically taking down an in-flight Elanga from behind. 50 min: … and they’re getting close again. Niang dribbles into the Toon box from the left and lashes a firm shot that pings off Pope’s chest. Then Zorgane has another of his long-distance digs. Pope behind this one too. 48 min: A long pass down the inside-right channel releases Khalaili, who chests down to get ahead of Burn. He flips a shot across Pope and inches wide of the left-hand post. Newcastle have clearly been told to get the match-clinching third, but there’s a reminder that one for USG would put a very different spin on events. 47 min: Woltemade is a force of nature. He eases Burgess out of the way on the edge of the USG D, and rolls a pass wide for Elanga, who doesn’t bother shooting because the whistle’s gone. A really soft free kick for Woltemade’s shove on Burgess, who went down easily. 46 min: Newcastle nearly make it three within 57 seconds of the restart. Woltemade sashays his way into space and flicks Elanga free down the right. Elanga enters the box and lashes a low drive that’s well parried by Scherpen. USG get the second half underway. They’ve swapped out David for Giger. Half-time postbag. “I think Eddie Howe has already won the most important European trophy this season: Pissing Off Bayern Munich. The fact that German football’s oldest bastion of morality is in such a twist over the Woltemade signing is absolutely delicious. I really hope he bags a hat-trick tonight because Karl-Heinz Rummenigge might actually spontaneously combust” – Chris Paraskevas “Clearly Joelinton forgot he isn’t playing in the Premier League. He was holding up his index finger as if to say: ‘Hang on, back in England I’m allowed at least one studs-up, shin-raking challenge before I even get a talking-to’ ” – John Cashman “Breaking News: Bayern Munich board call crisis meeting regarding Uefa’s decision on Woltemade goal. Press release imminent” – Chris Paraskevas “Major half-time talking point beginning with V, but not VAR. Good to see an old-fashioned Vic [Chambaere] on the USG bench; it seems to have gone out of the English game. Where are the Buckinghams and Haloms of yesteryear? Maybe, like long throws, Vics are due a come back” – Richard Hirst (who left off his list perhaps the greatest Vic of them all, Guthrie, Melchester Rovers’ badboy defender from the early 80s. For shame, Hirst, for shame) Half-time advertising break. Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now! It’s been easy for Newcastle so far, who have a new striker to worship in Nick Woltemade. Anthony Elanga, Sandro Tonali and Anthony Gordon haven’t been half bad either. 45 min: Burn attempts to quarterback a raking pass towards Elanga, only to blast the ball straight into the nearest yellow shirt. Suddenly the hosts are on the counter, and when a cross comes in from the right, Ait El Hadj comes very close to steering a riser into the top-right corner. Inches wide. What a gift that would have been. Gordon takes a deep breath before powering the penalty into the bottom-right corner, and this scoreline doesn’t flatter Newcastle at all. 42 min: Elanga dribbles in from the right and enters the box. He takes a heavy touch and stretches for it. As he does so, the lumbering Leysen hangs out a leg as well, and catches his man. The referee points straight to the spot. Gordon will take the penalty. 40 min: Gordon and Joelinton try to open USG up down the left with a close-quarters one-two. It nearly comes off. 39 min: Van De Perre follows Joelinton into the book for a forceful slide into Tonali. Half ball, half man. Maybe he’d get away with it in the Premier League. 37 min: Gordon and Woltemade take turns to showcase silky dribbling skills, worming their way out of a packed centre circle. The ball’s shifted right to Elanga, who crosses low. Gordon, who had kept going, can’t quite get on the end of it to sidefoot home from six yards. Burgess slides in to shepherd the ball back to his keeper. The ball hits Burgess’s supporting arm as the defender sprawls on the floor, and Gordon makes the claim, but it’s never a penalty, and as the keeper gathers, we all move on. That would have been a lovely goal had it come off. 35 min: Joelinton is booked for high-kicking Khalaili on the knee. He can have no complaints. But he does make some. The referee quite rightly not interested. That was late and clumsy, if not an aggressive act. 33 min: Elanga drives down the right, busy as ever, ahead of Leysen as usual. He pulls back but can’t quite find the new Toon goal machine Woltemade. Three goals already for his new club! 31 min: The Newcastle goal is Woltemade’s! Replays show he indeed did back-flick the ball into the bottom right, while standing in front of Mac Allister, who turns out didn’t get a touch. A lovely finish, and one he didn’t make a big thing about at the time with his celebration. Perhaps not wanting to steal Tonali’s thunder. What an absolute gentleman. 29 min: Tripper scampers after a long pass down the right. He cuts back from the byline for Joelinton, who attempts to steer a header back across the keeper and into the bottom right. His effort bounces inches wide. Scherpen’s feet were planted there. He was beaten. 27 min: Zorgane is popping up all over the shop now. He nearly releases Ait El Hadj down the right, dropping into the centre circle and sending a forensic diagonal pass towards his team-mate, but Botman reads it well to intercept. That was a crucial intervention. 25 min: Rodriguez twists and turns down the right, causing Botman all sorts. He wins a corner, from which that man Zorgane shoots again. This effort bounces through the crowd towards the bottom right, and Pope needs to turn it around the post. Nothing comes of the second corner, but this is much better from the hosts, who have finally turned up to their own party. 23 min: Niang has some space down the left and his low curling cross is deflected out for a corner. Zorgane sends the set piece long, taking the Newcastle defence by surprise – pretty much everyone is at the near post – and it deflects out for another corner. This one comes in from the right, and Zorgane now shoots through a crowded box from the edge of the D. Straight at Pope. He caught that well enough; anywhere other than straight at the keeper may have turned out problematic for the Toon. 21 min: Elanga crosses dangerously again from the right. Gordon flicks wide right while arriving at high speed. Newcastle sense blood. 19 min: Newcastle have been rewarded for their bright start. Mac Allister’s intervention played a big part in that goal, and Woltemade was by his side – initially it was suggested the striker got a flick - but Tonali’s initial shot was on target, so it’s his goal. Elanga crosses low from the right. Mac Allister heads clear, but only to Tonali, just to the right of the D. The ball drops to Tonali, who shoots towards the bottom left. Mac Allister sticks out a leg and diverts into the bottom right, the keeper having gone the other way. It had been coming! 16 min: Nothing comes of the second corner of the sequence, but Newcastle are pinning USG back. They come again through Elanga down the right, and … 15 min: Burn sends a long throw in from the left. In attempting to kick clear, Leysen slices hysterically behind for a corner. Tonali whips to the near stick. Woltemade makes his six-and-a-half-feet presence felt. Another corner coming up. 13 min: The resulting free kick leads to a corner, which leads to Tonali swinging in from the right, Scherpen once again electing to punch clear, and Joelinton flaying a wild shot over the bar. The USG keeper’s MO already clear. He likes throwing a haymaker! 12 min: Woltemade prepares to hold the ball up, only for Burgess, formerly of Portsmouth and the oldest Englishman to make his debut in the Champions League since Arsenal’s Steve Bould in the late 90s, to slide through the back of him. The USG captain slightly fortunate not to pick up a caution. 10 min: Newcastle are slowly taking control of the match in midfield. No great surprise, with USG happy to sit deep with five at the back. 8 min: Tonali, Elanga and Guimaraes paint a first-time zig-zag down the middle and into the USG box. Some crisp close-range passing. The ball eventually balloons into the air, and USG goalie Scherpen opts to punch clear rather than catch. An eccentric choice, as he’s not under too much pressure, but he gets plenty on it to clear his lines, and there is more than one way to skin a cat. 6 min: USG launch it long down the right. Botman attempts to hook back upfield, but only succeeds in kicking the ball into his own face and out for a corner. The set piece comes in from the right. Leysen, in the centre heads it back to the near post, from where Rodriguez eyebrows over the bar. That was a decent chance, and Newacstle were fortunate the USG striker didn’t get that on target. Had he done so, Pope was most likely picking the ball out of the net. 4 min: Tonali and Elanga combine well down the inside-right channel. The latter works himself a little space to shoot … but not enough so his eventual effort doesn’t get blocked the moment it leaves his boot. 2 min: Khalaili prepares to advance down the right only to be clipped to the floor by Joelinton. An early chance for the hosts to load the box and send something in. Ait El Hadj delivers, but to nobody in particular. Newcastle clear their lines. A friendly handshake between the coaches Eddie Howe and Sebastien Pocognoli … and then Newcastle get the ball rolling. The atmosphere intense as USG make their full Champions League home debut. The teams are out! USG in their yellow shirts with blue trim, Newcastle in those famous black and white stripes. We’ll be off in a couple of minutes. Eddie Howe talks to TNT Sports. “The result is very important for us tonight … the performance as well … we’re really excited about the game … we have to back our attacking players … we hope our team clicks … we have a point to prove tonight … we’ve set our plan out for tonight … we have to do it when the pressure is on.” Some pre-match reading. Courtesy of Louise Taylor in Brussels. Newcastle make two changes to the starting XI sent out to face Arsenal in the 2-1 Premier League defeat at St James’ Park last Sunday. Kieran Trippier and Anthony Elanga replace Tino Livramento and Jacob Murphy. The latter drops to the bench, but Livramento could be out for six to eight weeks after suffering a knee injury against the Gunners. Union Saint-Gilloise: Scherpen, Mac Allister, Burgess, Leysen, Khalaili, Zorgane, Van De Perre, Niang, Ait El Hadj, Rodriguez, David. Subs: Chambaere, Berradi, Patris, Sykes, Boufal, Giger, Schoofs, Smith, Rasmussen, Barry. Newcastle United: Pope, Trippier, Thiaw, Botman, Burn, Guimaraes, Tonali, Joelinton, Elanga, Woltemade, Gordon. Subs: Thompson, Ramsdale, Hall, Schar, Barnes, Krafth, Osula, Jacob Murphy, Willock, Alex Murphy, Miley. Referee: Urs Schnyder (Switzerland). Union Saint-Gilloise have only hosted English opposition once before. And if you’re a Newcastle fan relying on historical precedent to do you a favour this evening, you’re out of luck: USG beat Liverpool 2-1 in the Europa League groups in December 2023. To be fair to Jurgen Klopp’s side, it was a dead rubber in which they fielded several of the kids, but a win’s a win. So there is that to contend with. But how much should that history, tangential at best, weigh on Eddie Howe and his team’s mind? Not much, you’d have to say, especially as the Toon are unbeaten in eight matches against Belgian teams, winning seven and drawing the other. They’ll be more concerned about their own patchy form in the Premier League so far this season, and the fact USG impressively swatted aside PSV 3-1 in Eindhoven a couple of weeks ago, and that the Belgians – reigning champions in their homeland for the first time since 1935 – are unbeaten in seven group-stage matches in Uefa competition. Newcastle by contrast have lost four and drawn one of their last five Champions League games. Can they rediscover their mojo tonight in Brussels? We begin to find out at 5.45pm UK time. It’s on!"
Anthony Gordon double fires Newcastle to easy win at Union Saint-Gilloise,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/01/union-saint-gilloise-newcastle-champions-league-match-report,"Eddie Howe had reason to be wary. Up against a young hotshot coach and his high-flying Belgian champions, Newcastle’s manager must have felt a certain pressure at kick-off. Given Newcastle were still coming to terms with the departure of Alexander Isak and had been struggling for form, a balmy early October night in Brussels seemed far from the ideal time or place to meet Sébastian Pocognoli’s vibrant Union Saint‑Gilloise. A defeat at Anderlecht’s Lotto Park – Uefa deems Union SG’s own ground unsuitable for Champions League games – would have led some to consider Newcastle as being in crisis going into their Premier League date with a similarly stuttering Nottingham Forest on Tyneside on Sunday. Instead they will face Ange Postecoglou’s side with confidence restored after goals from the impressive Nick Woltemade, Anthony Gordon and Harvey Barnes ultimately overwhelmed Pocognoli’s spirited side. Throw in outstanding performances from Sandro Tonali and Anthony Elanga and it is easy to understand why the Geordie mood music had turned considerably more upbeat. “That’s what we wanted,” Howe said. “This was a big response from the players. Nick was excellent, he’s getting really embedded into the team. And we saw the best of Sandro.” Lotto Park was gloriously loud at kick-off and locals might have had something to celebrate had Kevin Rodríguez not directed a half‑chance over the bar after connecting with the fallout from Anouar Ait El Hadj’s corner. Ait El Hadj was operating as a No 10 in the hole behind Rodríguez and Promise David in a 3-4-1-2. Perhaps believing that fortune really does favour the brave, Pocognoli had persisted with his preferred twin‑striker system against a Newcastle defence featuring Dan Burn in his less assured left-back role. It was Pocognoli’s rearguard that came under the most intense early pressure, though. Kevin Scherpen, Union SG’s former Brighton goalkeeper, has a penchant for punching when catching looks more straightforward and this high-risk habit only exacerbated the strain on the former Portsmouth defender Christian Burgess and company. In the 17th minute their resistance broke when Woltemade’s sublimely subtle flick ensured that Tonali’s volley evaded Scherpen’s grasp. Howe says Tonali’s shot is so hard that he fears for his goalkeepers’ wrists in training, but just lately he has encouraged the Italy midfielder to have extra finishing practice. When Elanga’s cross was cleared only partially and the ball dropped for the Italian such homework apparently paid off. Yet although Howe’s players queued up to congratulate Tonali, Woltemade’s flick had actually diverted the volley in. It was the 6ft 6in striker’s third goal since arriving from Stuttgart for £70m in August. What a difference 12 months makes. Little more than a year ago Union SG were competing with Stuttgart to sign Woltemade and it says much for the Belgian club’s data-led recruitment system that Isak’s replacement is now not merely Newcastle’s record buy but a Germany international too. The home side responded by redoubling their efforts. David, a Canadian scouted by several Premier League clubs, began ruffling Burn and Nick Pope needed to dive low to turn Adem Zorgane’s shot around a post. A fortnight ago David had scored as Union SG marked their Champions League debut with a 3-1 victory at PSV Eindhoven but Newcastle were proving far tougher opponents. By half-time they had doubled their advantage, courtesy of Gordon’s impeccably executed penalty after Fedde Leysen felled Elanga. Although Ait El Hadj’s vision and movement subsequently caught Howe’s defence cold, the gifted Moroccan lifted his ensuing shot over the bar as the game drifted away from the hosts. Yet as outstanding as Woltemade’s hold-up and linking continued to be, Union SG still had their moments. When Anan Khalaili dodged Burn, Pope looked suitably relieved to see his angled shot fly fractionally wide as the drummers among the home fans resumed their almost incessant beating. It took Gordon’s second penalty of the night to subdue them, that kick having been awarded when a video assistant referee review confirmed his cross was handled by Kamiel Van de Perre. It proved the cue for the former Accrington defender Ross Sykes, the former Accrington defender and a lifelong Newcastle fan, to replace Kevin Mac Allister in a game he will surely never forget. Pope was required to save smartly when another home substitute, Sofiane Boufal, let fly from 25 yards. The Southampton old boy was soon upstaged when Barnes stepped off the bench and almost immediately swept Newcastle’s fourth goal home. It concluded a tremendous counterattack featuring stellar work from Will Osula and – perhaps inevitably – Gordon. “We’ve been waiting for a performance like that,” Howe said. “It was a big step in the right direction.”"
Birmingham’s Wagner urges EFL to sign single global broadcast deal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/01/birminghams-wagner-urges-efl-to-sign-single-global-broadcast-deal,"The Birmingham City co-owner Tom Wagner has said the EFL should sign a single global broadcast deal to grow the competition and showcase its “giant underdog mentality” to the world. Wagner, who led a consortium of investors that included the NFL legend Tom Brady in taking over Birmingham in 2023, argues the Football League should concentrate on growing its revenues and audience rather than focusing on a redistribution deal with the Premier League, which has stalled for two years despite government pressure. Speaking at The Summit, part of Leaders Week in London, Wagner was asked if he thought the EFL should consider striking a deal with a platform such as Netflix or Amazon. “I do,” he said. “I think that there’s an enormous opportunity for the EFL to create a broader distribution platform. And the reason I feel that way is because the quality of football is great. The storylines are great. There’s a lot to root for. It’s a giant underdog mentality, which, at least in the US, is massively appealing, and I suspect it would be elsewhere as well.” Reliable access to coverage of a competition, Wagner argued, helps to build fandom, an example he substantiated by talking about his gym habits. “I tend to torture myself in long workouts on Saturday and Sunday mornings,” he said. “When you’re pedalling away to nowhere, there’s a lot of media to consume. And I love when you begin to see Championship games broadcast. You know that when you can get it on your treadmill, that you’ve made it.” On the question of redistribution, Wagner called for a change of focus. “I think the best way to explain it is, rather than focusing on how we distribute an existing pie, we grow the pie,” he said. “We spend our time energy thinking about how we grow the overall revenue streams and interest in English football. If we’re able to do that, everybody benefits more than distributing an existing set of revenue streams in a different way. My comment has always been that we if we focus on growing the sport that we all win.” Birmingham head to north Wales this weekend to take on another Championship club with famous American owners and a documentary series. Wagner said the rivalry Birmingham have developed with Ryan Reynolds’ and Rob McElhenney’s Wrexham has benefited both clubs and is an example of the compelling stories football can create. “It’s great for both of us,” Wagner said. “And I have enormous respect for Ryan and Rob … they’re good people, and they’re doing a good thing. What they’ve done in Wrexham is amazing. “The people in Wrexham are incredible, period, full stop. It’s a wonderful place to go and visit and enjoy a football match. And that’s what I love about it.”"
"Donald Trump will not move World Cup matches, says Fifa vice-president",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/01/donald-trump-will-not-move-world-cup-matches-says-fifa-vice-president,"Any decision to move matches from World Cup cities for 2026 must be taken by Fifa, not Donald Trump, a vice-president of the organisation has said. Victor Montagliani, who is also the president of Concacaf, the confederation that covers North and Central America and the Caribbean, was speaking after the US president said this week he would move matches out of cities if he thought they could be “even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup”. He said San Francisco and Seattle were “run by radical left lunatics who don’t know what they’re doing”. “It’s Fifa’s tournament, Fifa’s jurisdiction, Fifa makes those decisions,” the Canadian said to an audience at The Summit, part of Leaders Week London. “With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them and football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans.” Montagliani, whose country is co-hosting the tournament with the US and Mexico, has frequently had to engage on diplomatic matters since the second Trump administration began. On the subject of Israel’s continued involvement in international football, which has been the subject of much debate in the past week, Montagliani said it was Uefa’s responsibility to take a decision. “I respect that it’s a decision by Uefa. It’s their member, they have to deal with it and I respect not only the appropriate process, but whatever decision they make. Fifa get asked to deal with a lot of things by a lot of organisations, but first and foremost it’s a member of Uefa. No different than when I have to deal with a member of my region for whatever reason.” On the contentious topic of Fifa competitions and their expanding reach, Montagliani said he was in favour of a bigger Club World Cup but against a 64-team World Cup for the centennial anniversary in 2030. “I don’t see the argument for 64 teams,” he said. “It’s not just us but Uefa and Asia who are opposed to that. But the Club World Cup was a massive success. We need to work out what’s feasible, [what] changes we need to make about the number of teams and the caps on each country we had for this year.”"
Curtis Jones calls on Liverpool to improve basics in order to correct form,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/01/curtis-jones-liverpool-galatasaray-defeat-reaction-chelsea-premier-league,"Curtis Jones has said Liverpool must improve the basics to correct their unconvincing run of form, including work rate and will to win, and believes they have enough world-class talent to ensure their problems will not deepen. Liverpool visit Chelsea on Saturday looking to recover from two consecutive defeats, against Galatasaray in the Champions League and, before that, Crystal Palace in the Premier League. It is only the second time that Arne Slot has suffered back-to-back losses as head coach. The champions produced another disjointed display in Istanbul where, despite dominating possession, the visitors rarely troubled Galatasaray’s goalkeeper, Ugurcan Cakir. Jones echoed Virgil van Dijk’s insistence that Liverpool have no reason to panic, but admitted Slot’s side must do more at all times to arrest their recent slide. “If you look left and right, there’s world-class lads all around,” the midfielder said. “But it is not all about that, it’s about lads who want to go and win. It’s OK if you’re nice on the ball and stuff like that but you have to go and win, work hard and run more. The lads know that, of course they do, but you have games like this and it won’t be the last as well. We would be mad to think we can turn up and just win these games. It’s about how much we want to win. “Of course we’re upset, but there are positives to take and there is a game again in three days and we have to go again.” Liverpool will be without Alisson at Stamford Bridge after he was forced off injured in Turkey. Hugo Ekitiké was also withdrawn but could be involved on Saturday if his injury turns out to have been cramp. Jones said the Chelsea game has assumed huge importance to Liverpool and an improvement on the Galatasaray performance is essential. “It is the Champions League and it is always going to be a hard game,” he said. “It’s [Galatasaray’s] biggest game of the year, I’d say, and I think it showed with the fans and how the players played as well. If you look at their first game, they get beat [5-1 by Eintracht Frankfurt], and if you look at it tonight, it didn’t even look like we could have scored. “We played out loads, it was positive at times when they came and pressed. Me, Ryan [Gravenberch] and Flo [Florian Wirtz] played through [the press] … but we’d like more shots and obviously more goals. “It’s just part of the game. You must be mad if you think you can win every game. You’d obviously like to but the reality is these teams you play are world-class and it’s normal if you lose, it’s just how you bounce back. We’ve got a huge game again in three days, the lads have to stay calm. It’s not fine that we lose but we just have to stay calm and it will all change, of course it will.”"
Chris Wilder and a miskick that proves: when your luck’s out your luck is out,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/01/chris-wilder-sheffield-united-football-daily-newsletter,"HAVE IT! While the likelihood of fans at Bramall Lane getting hit by wayward shots struck by Sheffield United players is higher than usual this season, when Football Daily heard breathless reports that their recently re-installed head coach had been shown a red card for booting the ball into some hapless bystander’s face last night, we immediately presumed he’d lost the plot and deliberately committed an aggressive act of potentially career-ending violence. It was only upon seeking out footage of the incident on some social media disgrace or another that we realised he’d done nothing of the sort. Indeed, the only crime the Blades boss was even remotely guilty of was submitting to one of humankind’s most basic and primeval urges, specifically: kicking a football that was rolling towards him. As he walked off the Bramall Lane pitch at half-time, one was tossed in the direction of some nearby substitutes who were about to warm up and happened to trundle directly into Wilder’s path. Without breaking stride, the 58-year-old undertook the civic and some might say moral obligation of every sentient male who finds themselves in a similar circumstances and put his boot through it without so much as a second’s hesitation or malice aforethought. As bad luck would have it, the insouciant swish of Wilder’s left peg was misjudged and he sent the ball fizzing into the stand behind the tunnel, where it hit a fan upside his coupon, knocking a hat from his head. Wilder immediately waved a hand by way of apology before climbing the steps to confirm that the gentleman in question was unharmed. Upon his return pitchside, he was sent off by referee Adam Herczeg and accepted the red card without much, if anything, in the way of complaint. Subsequently framed in some quarters as an act of aggression by a man under serious pressure, Wilder’s mishap actually appeared to be nothing of the sort and looked more like a slice of misfortune caused by a bloke who saw a ball rolling towards him and simply surrendered to his basic instinct to kick it. But while his “victim” was unhurt, clearly saw the funny side and now has a good story to tell his mates down the pub, it was probably right that Wilder had to go. Forced to sit out the second half of his side’s eventual defeat, he could now face up to three more games on the Naughty Step just for miskicking a football. Having racked up almost £455,000 in fines for what the Football Association described as an “incredibly poor period of behaviour” taking in six different matches last season, Sheffield United have seen several big decisions go against them in the current campaign. The main one coming after the playoff final when they binned off Wilder and appointed Rubén Sellés as his replacement before acknowledging and correcting their error. Following last night’s defeat, Wilder’s assistant Alan Knill undertook the obligatory media duties on behalf of his boss and blamed the match officials for United’s failure to rescue a point. “That’s the frustration really, everyone in the ground sees these incidents we’re talking about but the ones that matter don’t see it and it is a disappointing night where the officials haven’t really helped,” he fumed, slightly defeating his own argument by highlighting the completely correct decision to award Southampton a penalty they would go on to miss as one of two particular bones of contention. The other, a disallowed Sydie Peck header that might have rescued a point for the Blades was far more questionable but when your luck’s out, your luck is out, as both Wilder and that bloke in the HE Barnes Lower now know all too well.

QUOTE OF THE DAY “It’s a football community in mourning. It’s a huge loss. Mental health is a silent killer and coaches are human beings, and I still think we’ve got a lot of work to do to support more than just players. The LMA [League Managers Association] do a great job but, as the women’s game is growing, we have to reflect on how we support managers in the women’s game at every level, to navigate the pressures and the expectations” – Emma Hayes talks to Tom Garry about the death of her predecessor at Chelsea, Matt Beard, and how managers need more support to navigate the modern game. FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS The photo of John Aldridge (Tuesday’s letters) reminded me of a game 39 years ago (yikes!) on Saturday in which we beat that team 6-1 at Hillsborough, despite the two best players on the day – Aldridge and Ray Houghton – playing for our thrashed opponents” – Alan Burgess. All the talk these days about how players/clubs can’t possibly be expected to play three games per week is just numerical nonsense. The generally accepted fixture accumulation method appears to be as follows: Saturday, then no midweek game, then Saturday = one game a week. Saturday, midweek game, Saturday = three games per week. What happened to teams with European or domestic cup commitments having to play twice a week? Am I missing something here?” – Martin Fisher. I tittered like a schoolboy at Richard Pringle’s letter, which is pretty much what he would have hoped for I imagine. However, as far as football-related puerility goes, surely nothing beats Bern’s marvellously-monikered W@nkdorf Stadium?” – Phil Taverner. I’m not sure why Macclesfield FC isn’t at the top of your (obviously made up) Model Club Table (yesterday’s Football Daily). It ticks all the important boxes. Community revival of a bankrupted-but-now-phoenix club? Tick. Redeveloped stands and investment in women’s team? Tick. Rising through the lower leagues to the precipice of professionalism? Tick. Got rid of Robbie Savage as the face of the club? Tick, tick, tick!” – Mike Wilner. Re yesterday’s bob: “Arne Slot has claimed Liverpool’s defensive laps (sic) are definitely, definitely nothing to do with two new full-backs …”. Is he making them all run around the pitch every time they ship a goal?” – Steve Postle (and 1,056 others). If you have any, please send letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

David Beckham made $23.6m in dividends from business empire last year,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/01/david-beckham-earned-236m-in-dividends-from-business-empire-last-year,"David Beckham made $23.6m (£18.6m) in dividends from his personal business empire last year as Stella Artois and SharkNinja joined the football star’s roster of brand deals. Accounts for his company DRJB Holdings seen by the Guardian reveal a 44% rise in pre-tax profit to $44.9m in 2024, compared with $36m in 2023. The holding company paid out $52.5m in dividends last year to its investors including Beckham, up from $28.4m in 2023. That was followed by a further $23.2m this year, with about $10.4m of this also going to the sports star. It means that Beckham, who retired from professional football in 2013, has in the past two years alone taken more in dividends than the £25m that Real Madrid paid to buy him from Manchester United in 2003. The former England captain sold a 55% stake in his businesses in 2022 to the US group Authentic Brands for £200m. Beckham and his wife, Victoria, a former Spice Girl who owns an eponymous fashion brand, are worth an estimated £500m between them, according to the most recent Sunday Times Rich List. DRJB Holdings is made up of three divisions, the largest of which is DB Ventures, which covers most of his commercial partnerships with brands such as Hugo Boss and the eyewear group Safilo. This part of the business alone made $63.6m in revenue in 2024, up from $62.2m in 2023. The Seven Global division contains licensing agreements with companies such as Adidas. The remainder of the business is Studio 99, the production studio that made the Netflix documentary series about the former footballer, titled Beckham, which became one of the streaming service’s top 10 shows in all 90 countries where it was released. Studio 99 also produced Victoria Beckham’s Netflix documentary, which will be released later this month. In August, it was revealed that the Beckhams and the private equity firm Neo had pumped a further £6.2m into the former pop star’s fashion empire this year as losses widened to almost £5m despite a surge in sales in 2024. The company received £6.9m in cash and loans from shareholders last year. Investors in the fashion company include the former Spice Girls manager and Pop Idol creator Simon Fuller, as well as Neo and the Beckhams. This year, David Beckham was awarded a knighthood as part of King Charles’s birthday celebrations. The 50-year-old, who captained the England team for six years, received an OBE in 2003 and was reported to have been first put forward for a knighthood in 2011, after helping London win its bid to host the 2012 Olympic Games. While Beckham retired from professional football more than a decade ago, he remains an icon of the sport among the younger generation. He has a following of more than 160 million people on social media, the majority of whom are aged between 18 and 25. He is a co-founder and co-owner of the football club Inter Miami. This year, his business launched the supplement brand IM8 in partnership with the biotech company Prenetics, as well as securing an agreement with Hugo Boss for a co-designed menswear collection. He also secured a new contract with Verizon, the US telecommunications company. The company said it expected to announce further commercial partnerships in the coming months as the buildup to the 2026 Fifa World Cup gets under way. Authentic, the US sports and entertainment group that bought the majority stake in Beckham’s business two years ago, also owns rights to the images of Muhammad Ali, as well as stakes in popular fashion labels such as Reebok, Champion, Hunter and Forever 21."
Emma Hayes: ‘I don’t think coaches are always thought about as human beings’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/01/emma-hayes-i-dont-think-coaches-are-always-thought-about-as-human-beings-interview,"With hands raised eagerly, the children from Abbott Community primary school want to quiz the USA head coach. The plan was for Emma Hayes to take just a few questions from the youngsters at the National Football Museum, but she wants to answer them all. Even her son, Harry, watching on, raises a hand. The tone is light, fun and educational as Hayes celebrates induction into the Hall of Fame. The former Chelsea manager, who is being honoured by the museum for her coaching achievements, not least her seven Women’s Super Leagues titles and Olympic gold medal, is quick to point to how glad she is that the “women’s game is in a better place in this country” compared with when she took the Chelsea job in 2012. Alongside her smiles, though, there is a deep sadness. When later sitting down to speak to the Guardian, Hayes has words of warning for the sport: namely that it must learn lessons from the death of her predecessor at Chelsea, Matt Beard, after the shock news of his death aged 47 last month. “It’s a football community in mourning. It’s a huge loss,” Hayes says. “Mental health is a silent killer and coaches are human beings, and I still think we’ve got a lot of work to do to support more than just players. The LMA [League Managers Association] do a great job but, as the women’s game is growing, we have to reflect on how we support managers in the women’s game at every level, to navigate the pressures and the expectations. “We’ve entered an age in social media where people get ‘cancelled’ really quickly. It’s easy to criticise and I don’t think coaches are always thought about as human beings. I feel sad that he was in that position where he needed help and support from everyone, but that has to be a learning [for football]. I’m just devastated for his family and for everyone that’s played for him.” Hayes continues: “He gave so much to the women’s game and so much to all of us, in different ways. He was always on the end of the phone if you needed a chat. His players loved him because he cared about them deeply. He will be remembered most not just for his winning at Liverpool, but for the human being that he was.” Hayes knows Beard – who led Chelsea to their first women’s FA Cup final in 2012 before going on to win back-to-back titles at Liverpool – is a key part of the London club’s history, and her team went on to build on those foundations. Now she is delighted to see her successor at Chelsea, Sonia Bompastor, remain unbeaten in the WSL since taking over in the summer of 2024. “The marker for me wasn’t the trophies; it was that I could leave a team that could keep on winning,” Hayes says. “Sonia is doing an amazing job, and Paul Green [Chelsea’s head of women’s football], who deserves so much credit for what he’s done. [It is] why Chelsea are still at the top.” Hayes is similarly thinking about the future for the USA national team as she points to the importance of their youth sides when discussing her love for her latest job. The 48-year-old is also enjoying the work-life balance that comes with international management. “I’ve been so well received out there, they genuinely do love English people in America,” she says. “I feel they’ve adopted me and they look after me, I feel really loved. “I’m enjoying having a little bit more brain time in between, so I can think strategically about doing things instead of having a game every three days. I can plan medium-to-long term within the federation, to chart a course for not just the women’s national team but with our youth national teams, for how USA continues to compete at the top end.” Hayes would not be drawn on her hopes for the 2027 World Cup just yet. “We’ve got to qualify first, you must go one step at a time,” she says when asked about that tournament in Brazil. Her team are on a five-match winning run without conceding, though, and so she adds: “I feel like we’re in a good place. We still need more experience and that’s what we have to try to acquire in these upcoming games, getting them the right exposures at an international level so that, come the qualifications next year, we feel fully prepared, so I’m really excited about our team.” Whatever she goes on to achieve with the USA, Hayes’s place in English football history is secure, and being inducted into the Manchester-based museum’s Hall of Fame is clearly a moment of great pride for her. “I view football as a vehicle for good, and when I reflect on all the things I’ve done in my career to this point, the things I’m most grateful for aren’t the wins, they aren’t the individual acknowledgments, it’s the people I’ve met, it’s the foundations that have been put in place for the game,” she says. “I’m just so grateful the women’s game is in a better place in this country.” • In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

‘You can see the creativity’: Van de Ven says Simons can spark Spurs revival,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/01/micky-van-de-ven-xavi-simons-tottenham,"Micky van de Ven believes Xavi Simons could be the solution to the creative flatness threatening to undermine Tottenham’s start to the season. With Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison sustaining long-term injuries and Dominic Solanke undergoing a procedure on his troublesome ankle, Tottenham have started to look a little predictable in forward areas and form has stuttered over the past month. Thomas Frank acknowledged before Spurs’ 2-2 Champions League draw with the Norwegian champions, Bodø/Glimt, on Tuesday that the almost complete change to the front four – with Son Heung-min having left – has created problems. Simons arrived from RB Leipzig just before the end of the transfer window for more than £50m. He is still adapting, but he set up a goal against West Ham and played a key role coming off the bench in Tottenham’s late comeback in Norway. “He’s a really good player,” said Van de Ven, who headed Spurs’ first goal. “He can create a lot of special things. I think you saw he came on and did really well. You can see the creativity he has.” Although Van de Ven, like Simons, has played in the Netherlands and Germany, they have never played against each other, but the defender does know him from the Netherlands national side and clearly feels a responsibility to his compatriot. “I speak a lot with him,” Van de Ven said, “but what also helps him a lot is he speaks a lot of languages so he can get on with a lot of other players as well. I try to help him on and off the pitch with every small detail he asks for. I’m there for him to help him as much as possible.” Tottenham’s early-season momentum has slightly stalled in recent weeks, and they have conceded the opening goal in three of their past four games – the exception was Doncaster in the Carabao Cup. Frank was not overly concerned, pointing out the circumstances in each of those matches – against Brighton, Wolves and Bodø/Glimt – were very different. Tuesday was the only one of the three games in which Spurs really looked second-best. Van de Ven, like his manager, preferred to focus on the resilience Tottenham have shown to battle back and draw on all three occasions. “From our side, it was a really difficult game,” he said. “We were 2-0 down and it shows our mentality to come back to 2-2 and get a point. Today was not our best performance, of course. We struggled a bit.” With Cristian Romero absent, Van de Ven captained Spurs for the first time and he looks certain to be part of a leadership group that Frank will name on Thursday. “It was a proud moment to lead the group out in a Champions League game,” he said. “To be honest I went into the game the same as I always do. It’s not like there is some extra pressure on you. But it’s a moment you dream of when you’re a kid.”"
Which Premier League manager has the highest low-possession record in a game?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/01/which-premier-league-manager-has-the-highest-low-possession-record-in-a-game-knowledge,"“Manchester City had 32.8% possession in their 1-1 draw at Arsenal last month, the lowest of Pep Guardiola’s career,” begins Graham Murphy. “Do any managers have a higher lowest-possession figure in the English top flight?” That figure of 32.8% was the lowest for Guardiola in a league game, as mentioned in last week’s column. We can’t compare him to every Premier League manager, mainly because possession stats were only recorded from the 2003-04 season onwards. Instead, we asked our friends at Opta to deliver the statistical goods on selected managers, past and present. At least five have a higher lowest-possession figure, though two of them – Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsène Wenger – are subject to that 2003-04 caveat. For the last decade of Ferguson’s career, the lowest possession that a Manchester United team had in a Premier League game was 39.4% against Arsenal at Old Trafford in May 2009. United needed a draw to seal their 18th league title; a 0-0 draw got the job done. Ferguson is top of our list, a nose ahead of one of his successors: Louis van Gaal, who was often accused of prioritising possession over penetration in his two years at Old Trafford. An exception was United’s first away win under Van Gaal, a 2-1 victory at the Emirates in November 2014 when they had a modest 38.6% possession. There are a couple of recurring themes on this list: the first is that each manager’s lowest possession often came in a victory or at least a draw. The other is the involvement of Arsenal and one of the Manchester clubs. Arsenal’s lowest possession under Wenger (from 2003-04 onwards) came against Manchester City at the Etihad in January 2015, when Arsenal won 2-0 with 35.3% of the ball, finding a less-is-more template for dealing with the toughest away games. The other two managers with a higher figure than Guardiola, Arne Slot and Enzo Maresca, are only in their second Premier League season and thus have a much smaller simple size. But both recorded their lowest percentage possession during a win – Slot against Guardiola’s Manchester City in February, Maresca against Slot’s Liverpool in May. Here’s the top eight, in table form: And selected others: 28.8% Unai Emery, Aston Villa 2-2 Chelsea, April 2024 24.2% José Mourinho, Liverpool 2-1 Tottenham, December 2020 19.6% Mikel Arteta, Manchester City 5-0 Arsenal, August 2021 18.0% Eddie Howe, Bournemouth 0-1 Manchester City, March 2019 Drawn-out campaigns “Motherwell have drawn their first five league games, apparently a Scottish record,” points out John McAlpine. “What’s the record for consecutive league draws, both from the start of the season and overall?” Motherwell’s attempt to make the record books ended with a disappointing 2-0 victory over Aberdeen last Saturday, giving them a Scottish Premiership record of P6 W1 D5 L0 Pts 8. We say attempt because, as Chris Roe points out, five consecutive draws at the start of the season isn’t a record across the four main Scottish leagues: Dumbarton started their 2024-25 League One campaign with six draws in a row. (And, as Mad Mac writes, Motherwell also started 1975-76 with five league draws.) Chris and his magic database also spat out two English teams whose new-season optimism was dulled by six successive draws: Stockport County in 1973-74 (Fourth Division) and Leicester City in 1976-77 (First Division). The record for consecutive draws at any stage of a season in England’s top four divisions appears to be eight in a row. That’s shared by seven teams, starting with Torquay United in 1969-70 and continuing through to Swansea City in 2008-09. Real Zaragoza managed nine in a row in Spain’s Segunda Division in 2021-22, a run matched by Woking in the 2002-03 Football Conference. Woking’s season was a sequence spotter’s wildest dream. Between November and February, the Cards had a win-loss-win-loss run that lasted for 12 games; then, after a couple more defeats to mix things up, they drew nine games in a row. Here’s the full sequence from 23 November 2002 to the end of the season, with the Knowledge-tastic bits in bold: WLWLWLWLWLWLLLDDDDDDDDDW. We did find one example of a team drawing 10 league games in a row. This came from an unanswered Knowledge question from Sean DeLoughry in November 2005. Dundalk have now notched up an impressive 10 draws in a row in the Irish first division. Is this a record for the most consecutive draws? Sean, apologies for the slight delay in getting back to you, but we think it might be. Some people are on the pitch … “Last week, St Mirren’s fans celebrated their Scottish League Cup quarter-final win at Kilmarnock with a pitch invasion. Has there ever been such a large-scale pitch invasion so early in the season?” wonders Rohan Back. The answer may depend on your interpretation of the phrase “large scale”, but we reckon this is worthy offering from Ken Foster. “In the 2023-24 National League, promotion favourites Oldham equalised at Chesterfield in added time for a 1-1 draw. Hundreds of Oldham fans invaded the pitch and the game never kicked off again. That was in the fourth match of the season on 19 August.” Supporters of both clubs fought on the pitch and Oldham were eventually fined £5,000 by the FA. Chesterfield eventually got over losing two points at the last. “We won the league,” continues Ken, “and finished 35 points ahead of Oldham.” Knowledge archive “Last week’s Knowledge touched on the subject of football magazines recording hard shots, long throws and other niche feats,” we wrote in 2020. “Alex Murphy may have witnessed the longest throw ever for a magazine series he worked on in the 1990s. “I don’t know if Shoot! covered the subject as well, but the magazine I worked on as features editor – Total Football – had a long-running obsession with long throw-ins,” wrote Alex. “One day we trotted down to St Andrew’s with a photographer and a 50m tape measure and invited Birmingham City and Wales midfielder, Andy Legg, to attempt a new world record. Despite suffering from an ankle knock, and amid complaints about the wet surface, Legg hurled a football the entire width of the pitch. “The feat was officially witnessed by myself and Blues midfield ace Paul Tait (he of the infamous ‘Shit on the Villa’ T-shirt) and our signed affidavits were accepted by a surprisingly lax and unquestioning Guinness Book of Records. Legg’s feat was duly recorded in the following year’s volume. I recall with shame that our headline on the feature was: ‘What a tosser!’ “A few months later we invited legendary Tranmere Rovers thrower-inner, Dave Challinor to take on Legg’s mark. He did it with ease, and took his place in the next edition of the book. Alas, the carefully chosen headline on this feature announced: ‘What an even bigger tosser!’ We were young and foolish.” Since then Challinor has lost his world record, which is currently held by American flip-thrower Michael Lewis, who hurled a ball 59.17 metres in Frisco, Texas in April 2019 (that’s well over the halfway line). Here he is showing off his skills in 2015. Can you help? “Long throws are all the rage these days,” begins Ed Warren. “Who, if anyone, pioneered the use of the long throw into the six-yard box?” “Sitting through Brentford v Manchester United on Saturday, it became clear that regardless of personnel, Ruben Amorim will not shift from his 3-4-2-1 even if the pope were to force him,” notes Paul Vickers. “This got me thinking: has there ever been a case of players actively defying a manager’s instructions, not by downing tools and giving up, but by taking up self-devised, alternative tactics and positions that they consider better suited to their abilities and the needs of the team? And what was the outcome of any such defiant player self-management in terms of the immediate result and then the subsequent fate of the manager and the players?” “Saturday’s win at Accrington, combined with results elsewhere, ensured that Walsall finished September and began October at the top of League Two,” explains Darren Fellows. “This means they’ve topped League Two in January, February, March, April, September and October. Has there been another club to have led the same division (over two consecutive seasons) for at least six separate months?” “Yeni Malatyaspor lost 45 consecutive matches across all competitions before finally holding on for a draw on Sunday. Has any professional club ever had a longer loss streak?” asks Ben Nem. Mail us with your questions and answers"
Faux-humble José Mourinho plays his part on oddly tender Chelsea return,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/30/faux-humble-jose-mourinho-plays-his-part-on-oddly-tender-chelsea-return,"The whump of pitchside flames, the tinny theatre of the Uefa anthem, a craning of necks, a rising crackle of energy. And finally there he was out on the Stamford Bridge touchline, like some fond, long-lost figure emerging from the steam, suitcase in hand, while Jenny Agutter says Daddy, my daddy and rushes in for a hug. Except of course, this daddy is just as likely to jab her in the eye, before knee-sliding provocatively down the platform and making a series of borderline defamatory remarks in a press conference. José Mourinho has been back to Chelsea many times. Why should this one matter more? Perhaps because he might not be back again. Perhaps because there is also very little else riding on these early Champions League mega-table games, a workaday 1-0 Chelsea victory here just another autumn footnote. Either way the whole occasion carried a little more pathos this time. Before kick-off on the Fulham Road the José scarves hung like ripe fruit, overseen by at least one very stern José cardboard cutout. Earlier in the week Chelsea fans could be heard across various platforms talking in husky tones about the return of the king, the paterfamilias, the architect of a pop-up mega-club. In the event Mourinho was performatively coy at the start, emerging last from the tunnel, siting primly in his pitchside seat. No. Don’t mind me. But he was up straight away as the game kicked off, looking slick and trim in a classic Crombie-length overcoat and open-neck tailored shirt, like a tech billionaire on his way to a court hearing. The crowd chanted his name, as they did all night off and on, and were met instantly with a faux-humble wave. And this was basically a chance to watch an old bloke having a really good time out there. Mourinho isn’t really a coach these days. He’s a portable human fame event, a real-time José Mourinho happening. Asked once why he didn’t seek fame on the literary circuit Philip Larkin replied that he didn’t want to “go around pretending to be myself”. José, well, José is the exact opposite of this. At one point in the first half Enzo Fernández went to take a corner and was pelted with cups by the Benfica fans. It made for an ideal Mourinho moment. There he was parading down the touchline, both hands above his head in a papal gesture, the peacemaker. Maybe José and not Tony Blair should be out there defusing the ancient hatreds of Gaza. It would at least be box office. If there was something slightly double-take about all this, like a dream where your long-dead uncle is suddenly serving drinks and cracking jokes at his own wake, it also felt oddly tender. The game changes. José doesn’t change. Although the thing that hasn’t changed in the past two weeks is that Benfica are not a great team. They went 1-0 down thanks to Richard Ríos’s own goal, and stayed 1-0 down to the end, but still had enough in the second half to threaten the Chelsea goal. Mourinho will like the spirit and the physicality. This club was also his first job 25 years ago. But he will struggle to create any real Porto-style alchemy here. Football is too stratified now. You can’t make that leap up. Is Mourinho still an elite coach? Almost certainly not. In an odd twist the tactical weather vane seems to have swung back his way. Power. Set pieces. Headers. These are all hot right now. But it is also a pointless question at this stage, and a common mistake to assume he has no wider legacy, no sphere of inflection over modern football. Pep Guardiola retains his tactical influence. But Mourinho perfected the other half of the modern game, the weaponising of stage management and personality. His return here was not a hangover from some other world. It was bang up to date, a piece of pure theatre, entertainment product, a Mourinho Tuesday night Vegas special. Mourinho made those things into vital elements, the original influencer, the first clips man, the first viral figure. Football as moments, personality, show. This is just as big in the modern game as passing the ball back to the goalkeeper. It is also easy to overlook that Mourinho has a second life as an avatar of internet football authenticity. Young people get him. He has that vital quality, aura. From early José, so absurdly handsome he would probably need to be pixelated now or accompanied by a content warning, to the late, chic, cartel boss overlord look. All of this lives on in memes, clips, web heritage, the current mode as final-boss dropper of truth bombs. It isn’t hard to see why his enduring fascination might be bound up with a nostalgia for a more vivid, less orderly footballing landscape. The José years look pretty wild now. Mourinho once threw a dog over a wall because the police were at the front door. Has Fabian Hürzeler ever done this? Is it possible to imagine Arne Slot doing it? There was of course nothing pure about those times. Mourinho still speaks to the macro-oddity of the Chelsea project, installed by a Kremlin-connected oligarch, with a founding era built on the total absence of financial controls. London was becoming London-grad. History had ended, Vladimir Putin was a taciturn man in a suit, Roman Abramovich a handsome playboy with a yacht. In many ways what happened with Mourinho and Chelsea happened to all of us, a small sporting chapter of an unfolding fable of power and shifting tectonic plates. Of course seeing him here in west London again carries not just a theatrical power, but a sense of time passing. At the end he looked a little drained as he spoke about legacy and the past in reflective tones. But there was a further irony watching this current Chelsea team struggle a little under the intricate promptings of Enzo Maresca. Here is a visiting manager who has everything Chelsea’s owners want: star power, eyeball-magnetism. But also everything they could never actually work with: egotism, charisma, insurrectionary qualities. Say what you like about Mourinho’s gracelessness, his bending of the rules. He is also obsessed with the game, and with glory. Who would you rather watch, the dark lord in all his curdled power, or a man with an iPad, a squad acquired like a stock portfolio, the US vision of football as mobile leisure product?"
‘Don’t panic’: Van Dijk’s message to Liverpool fans after second defeat in four days,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/30/virgil-van-dijk-liverpool-fans-galatasaray-champions-league-defeat,"Virgil van Dijk insisted Liverpool should not panic despite back-to-back defeats for only the second time under Arne Slot at Galatasaray. Injuries to Alisson and Hugo Ekitiké added to Liverpool’s worries as their head coach defended the performance and his decision to rest Mohamed Salah in Istanbul. Victor Osimhen’s first-half penalty condemned Liverpool to defeat in the Champions League. The Premier League leaders had relinquished their 100% winning start to the season at Crystal Palace on Saturday but Van Dijk was adamant that a remodelled team will recapture title-winning form. The Liverpool captain said: “I think we have showed it already in many games this season but we haven’t shown it for the full 90 minutes yet unfortunately. It is absolutely normal and nowadays you don’t get the time from the outside world so you have to be strong mentally. “I am very confident. We have to keep working and sticking together. We had a good start this year in terms of points tally. There shouldn’t be panic, but improvement is needed.” Slot confirmed that the goalkeeper Alisson will miss the trip to Chelsea on Saturday with a muscle problem. Ekitiké was also withdrawn in the second half with an unspecified injury, after going down holding the back of his leg late on. “Alisson felt something when he sprinted back,” Slot said. “Normally when a player sprints back and feels something and goes to the floor and doesn’t come back to the pitch – which by the way they did 112 times being injured and coming back on the pitch without any pain – then I fear the worst and that is what happened with Alisson. He will not be able to play Saturday, 99.9%.” As for Liverpool’s latest defeat, the head coach said: “For me it was a different loss to the one we had against Palace because there was a lot more to like, especially in the first half. “In the second half it became harder and harder for us to create because first of all they were fighting with all they had and you have to give credit to them, and secondly the ball was hardly in play in the second half.” Slot said he rested Salah until the 62nd minute to avoid risking injury following the forward’s recent workload."
José Mourinho says he wants results not memories after defeat on Chelsea return,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/30/jose-mourinho-benfica-chelsea-return-champions-league,"José Mourinho said that he is sustained by wins rather than memories after the Benfica manager endured a 1-0 defeat on his latest return to Chelsea. Mourinho, winless in his past seven trips to his old club, was grateful to receive a fine reception from the Stamford Bridge crowd on Tuesday. But the most successful manager in Chelsea’s history was frustrated in his quest for victory and already faces a challenge to lead Benfica into the knockout stages of the Champions League. It left the 62-year-old reluctant to dwell on his two glorious spells at Chelsea. “I don’t feed myself with these memories, I feed myself with results,” Mourinho said. “My career took me to a position where everybody thinks I have magic to make things happen. “I left Man United after winning things, I left Tottenham after taking them to a final, Roma after two European finals. With me it is never enough. If I am in a job I like to put myself on the line every day. I am desperate to win the match, that is the nature.” Mourinho felt that Benfica, who lost because of a Richard Ríos own goal, merited a point. “We deserved something. We started well, we controlled and had chances for sure. The goal is the only mistake we made defensively.” Enzo Maresca was happy that Chelsea secured their first win of the league phase and bounced back after a poor run. But the head coach was left frustrated when João Pedro was sent off in added time. It was Chelsea’s third red card in as many games. João Pedro will be suspended against Ajax later this month, leaving Chelsea short of options in attack. “Another red card that we need to avoid,” Maresca said. Chelsea were not at their best but fought for the points and will face Liverpool on Saturday with renewed belief. “We needed the win,” Maresca said. “Second half we dropped. We have some players on the pitch that unfortunately are not 100% but are playing because we have seven or eight out. Sometimes you need to learn to win in an ugly way.”"
Galatasaray 1-0 Liverpool: Champions League – as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/sep/30/galatasaray-v-liverpool-champions-league-live,"Andy Hunter was at the Ali Sami Yen and here’s his report. Thanks for reading this MBM. Arne Slot talks to Amazon Prime. “Disappointed because you lose … this was a different performance on and off the ball than last Saturday … first half we played quite well … a big chance to go 1-0 up … we controlled the counter-attack … Domink [Szoboszlai] felt he did nothing wrong … we are sometimes a bit outsmarted in situations like this … they make maybe a 20 percent penalty a 100 percent penalty … it was very smart of them … in the second half there was not a lot of playing time … their striker was four or five times on the floor … subs … injuries … difficult to get momentum … eight minutes added on was not more than expected from me … then he blew his whistle exactly on eight … the focus is always on new signings … that is normal, especially with the amount of money we pay … I have to manage minutes … all the players must adjust to each other … we have only lost one Champions League game and one Premier League game.” Slot also reports that Hugo Ekitike is “hopefully not in a bad way” but “you can be sure Alisson is not playing [at Chelsea] on Saturday.” It’s two defeats on the bounce for Liverpool. It’s only the second time that’s happened under the leadership of Arne Slot, who looks disappointed as he congratulates his hosts on a win they thoroughly merited. Cody Gakpo had a shot cleared off the line, but otherwise Galatasaray keeper Uğurcan Çakır had very little to do all evening; Alisson did, though, but just like against Crystal Palace last weekend, all it achieved for Liverpool was keeping the score down to respectable levels. Victor Osimhen’s penalty was enough in the end, but on a more clinical night the Nigeria international would have bagged a hat-trick. Barış Alper Yılmaz had a big chance as well. There’s no need for panic, but there’s work for Liverpool to do to get their reshaped squad clicking nonetheless. It might take a little time. The Ali Sami Yen explodes with joy as their team see out a deserved victory! 90 min +7: Lemina and Sanchez both go down with cramp. The referee Clément Trossard Turpin taps his watch theatrically. 90 min +6: Cimbom are keeping Liverpool at arm’s length. The visitors don’t look like scoring. 90 min +5: Van Dijk hesitates with the ball at his feet on the edge of his own box. He’s swarmed. It all comes at the expense of Gala’s first corner of the second half! They play it short, then eventually put the cross in. Torreira meets it on the edge of the box and fizzes a low drive inches wide left. Mamardashvili almost certainly had it covered, but nevertheless, that was close. 90 min +3: Amid a cacophony of whistling, Kerkez wins a corner down the left. Mamardashvili wonders whether he should come up for it. He’s categorically told no. The set piece is half cleared, then Mac Allister slices a wild long-range shot miles right. 90 min +2: … but there will be eight additional minutes. Still enough time for Liverpool to save themselves? 90 min +1: Even worse for Liverpool, they’d been building up a head of steam for the first time in the game before that incident. Now that’s been snapped by the wait for VAR. Frustrated, Wirtz takes a handful of Singo’s shirt and goes into the book. 90 min: … but VAR wants a word. Did Singo win the ball before touching his man? Yes! Decision overturned. There’s no penalty lifeline for Liverpool. The wrong decision made right. 88 min: The corner leads to utter bedlam in the box. Wirtz can’t get his shot away. The ball’s half cleared. Mac Allister swings it back into the mixer from the right. Jones heads down to Konate, who swivels to kick. He’s nicked by Singo and the referee points to the spot! Cakir is booked for complaining about it. 87 min: Liverpool keep hold of the ball but do absolutely nothing with it. But then suddenly they spring to life, Salah playing a reverse pass down the right for Bradley, who wins a corner. Szoboszlai to take. 85 min: Yilmaz, who has been excellent from the get-go tonight, makes way for Elmalı. 84 min: If Liverpool lose this, it’ll be just the second time under Arne Slot that they’ll have lost two games in a row. The first: the defeat to PSG at Anfield in last season’s Champions League, followed by the League Cup final loss agaisnt Newcastle. 82 min: For the first time this evening, Liverpool are dominating possession and pressing Galatasaray back. But in the face of all the probing – most of it down the right by Salah - the hosts are holding their shape, and their composure. 80 min: Icardi is booked for a transgression not particularly clear. 79 min: Salah tricks his way down the right and slips infield for Szoboszlai, who enters the box but can’t get the ball under control to shoot. 78 min: Liverpool once again heading towards the last few minutes in search of a little something. 76 min: … and nothing comes of the free kick. Play restarts, and Salah makes off down the right again. He’s grabbed by Jakobs, who goes into the book. 75 min: Jones is sent sprawling by Torreira. Liverpool want to play on, with Salah in acres down the right and preparing to feed Bradley in the middle. But the referee blows for a free kick. The visitors fuming. Before the free kick can be taken, Sara comes on for Gundogan. 73 min: Bradley is booked for catching Yilmaz late from behind. No complaints. 72 min: Galatasaray now make their change. In fact it’s a double. Osimhen is replaced by Icardi as intended; Sallai also comes on, for Akgün 71 min: Wirtz has gone out to the left to fill in for the departed Ekitike … and he immediately delivers a fine raking cross. Bradley, coming in from the other flank, is under less pressure than he thinks, and heads back across the face of goal and out for a goal kick. That was a good chance from eight yards out. 69 min: Ekitike can’t continue, and Mac Allister comes on in his place, so there goes Liverpool’s last sub. However Osimhen insists he’s fine to continue, so Galatasaray put that change on hold. 68 min: Osimhen is back up on his feet, but cutting a frustrated figure. It doesn’t look as though he’ll be risked any further. Icardi prepares to come on in his place. 67 min: Yılmaz tries to tee up Osimhen on the edge of the Liverpool D, but plays the ball too far ahead of the striker. Osimhen stretches, but can’t control to shoot. He stays down. Liverpool counter, and Ekitike also goes down having stretched for a loose pass. On come the trainers. 65 min: Bradley has slotted into his right-back position, so Szoboszlai moves into the space vacated by Gravenberch. Salah takes over the right wing from Frimpong, with Ekitike moving wide left. 63 min: Isak’s immediately into the action, zipping down the left and flicking a shot intended for the far corner straight at the keeper. 62 min: Liverpool make a triple change. Gravenberch, Frimpong and Gakpo make way for Bradley, Isak and Salah. 61 min: … so having just typed that, the referee gets his card out. To be fair, he had zero option. Bardakcı for a tug on Wirtz’s shirt. 60 min: Szoboszlai catches Yılmaz on the inside of the boot and then moans about the free kick that’s awarded. He should be grateful that the referee is in a lenient mood, because that combo is often enough to warrant a yellow card. Just a wag of the finger. 58 min: Liverpool are currently playing like they’ve drunk far too much coffee. The passing skittish, too quick, shaky, nervous. The ball a hot potato. Can they calm themselves down? Will Galatasaray – specifically Osimhen – rue missing those two big chances? 56 min: … but Alisson has hurt himself, going down to smother that shot, and he can’t continue. Mamardashvili comes on in his place. 54 min: Liverpool offer Osimhen another gift, Konate and Gravenberch combining to miscontrol and lose the ball. Osimhen strides clear and enters the box. He opens his body and aims a sidefoot towards the bottom right, but Alisson gets down well to smother. Another huge chance for the hosts! 53 min: Szoboszlai whips into the crowded mixer from the left … straight into the nearest man, Gundogan. The ball cannons out for a corner. Gakpo hoicks that in, and Cakir palms it away. 52 min: Jones tries to turn Torreira down the left and is brought down just outside the box. A free kick in a dangerous position. Effectively a Turbo Corner. Szoboszlai to take. 50 min: Osimhen nicks the ball off Jones and advances on the Liverpool box. He’s got Akgün free to his right, but decides to shoot himself. However, in checking his stride for optimum shooting power, he allows Jones to brilliantly recover and toe-poke away from behind. Osimhen wants a free kick, but it was a perfectly timed challenge. What a waste for Cimbom. 48 min: Frimpong drops a shoulder and bursts past Jakobs on the right. He crosses for Gakpo, who is gently eased out of the road mid-leap. Then Frimpong comes again, reaching the byline down his right flank and cutting back for Ekitike, who performs a slick backflick that’s heading into the bottom corner. Cakir kicks clear. 46 min: Konate launches long down the right. Jakobs gets his header back to Cakir all wrong, and nearly loops the ball over the keeper with Frimpong lurking. The keeper stretches every sinew to claw away. So nearly a big gift for Liverpool. Galatasaray get the second half started. No changes, though Alexander Isak and Joe Gomez have been warming up during the break. Half-time postbag. “As much as I’m baffled that no big club made a serious play for Victor Osimhen, it feels pleasingly retro that a team from outside the big five leagues has one of the best strikers in the world on its books. It evokes a time when teams from the Balkans or Belgium were serious contenders for winning the European Cup” – Kári Tulinius “Liverpool miss Szoboszlai badly when he’s not in midfield” – Dean Kinsella “The referee looks like Leandro Trossard’s dad” – Gary Naylor Galatasaray’s impressive home record against Liverpool continues apace. Can the English champions respond in the second half? 45 min +6: … but though Bardakcı’s shot pinged up and onto Szoboszlai’s arm, neither referee nor VAR shows any interest in awarding one. To be fair, that was from close range in a crowded box, and Szoboszlai knew nothing about it. But that would have put the tin lid on a difficult first half for Liverpool’s makeshift right-back. 45 min +5: Bardakcı drives the ball into the box. Ekitike hoicks it away. Galatasaray want a penalty, though … 45 min +4: … but then Osimhen barrels down the left and cuts back for Singo, whose shot squirts out for a goal kick. Liverpool try to play out from the back, and Gravenberch gifts the ball to Osimhen, who advances towards the box. Gravenberch trips him from behind, and that’s a free kick inside the D. Gravenberch is booked. No chance of a red card, as Osimhen was surrounded. But this is a big moment now for Liverpool. They have to survive this last act of the half. 45 min +2: All a bit scrappy as the half fizzles out. 45 min: There will be three additional first-half minutes. 44 min: Singo buys a soft free kick off Kerkez down the Galatasaray right. Everyone lines up on the edge of the Liverpool box. Gundogan swings the ball in, but that’s easy pickings for Alisson. 42 min: Akgün has a chance to release Yilmaz down the middle, but seriously overcooks the pass. As Alisson claims it, Yilmaz offers Akgün some beneficial advice. 40 min: Torreira high-kicks Jones and this is getting a bit spiky now. Another free kick for Kerkez out on the left. This time he sends it straight into the box … and the flag immediately goes up for some overly aggressive Liverpool pushing. Free kick. Pressure off. 38 min: A break in play so Jones can get the bloody nose Lemina’s just given him patched up. Konate needs some treatment as well, having been hit upside the head earlier in the move. Both are fixed and will be OK to continue. 36 min: Jones tries to burst into space down the middle and is crudely checked by Lemina, who goes into the book. The Gala midfielder very fortunate he only copped for a ticking-off upon bringing down Gravenberch earlier. But he’s on the disciplinary tightrope now. 34 min: Wirtz finds himself in a pocket of space and time just outside the Cimbom D. He shoots! He clanks the ball into the nearest defender! It’s just not happening for Wirtz in a Liverpool shirt. Not yet. It’ll surely come. 33 min: Konate heads egregiously wide left from a couple of yards out. He should have scored. Then Galatasaray break through Osimhen down the right. Osimhen tries to float a chip over Alisson from distance, but the keeper gets back just in time to claim. The linesman puts his flag up for offside, but that was closer than he thought. Had Osimhen found the net, VAR would have had to get the old rulers out. 32 min: Gakpo chips a cross from the left towards Frimpong, who wins a header at the far post and cushions the ball down for his good friend Wirtz. Wirtz swivels, then digs out an effort that’s heading into the top right. Cakir claws it around the post, and from the resulting corner, there’s a meleé in the six-yard box. Neither Kerkez nor Ekitike can poke home. The ball’s deflected out for another corner, from which … 30 min: Osimhen gallops down the right and pings in a low cross that Konate has to hook out for a corner under pressure from Yilmaz. From the resulting set piece, Sanchez tries his luck with an overhead kick from the middle of a crowded box. Full marks for effort, if nothing else. But once again, Liverpool do not look 100 percent assured at the back. 28 min: Wirtz tries a Gravenberchesque spin in midfield and is easily dispossessed by a combination of Sanchez and Torreira. But with the hosts flooding forward, the referee awards Wirtz a generous free kick. Liverpool’s big signing still not up to speed. 26 min: Ekitike sends Gakpo striding into space with a cool flick down the left flank. Gakpo drifts infield and has the option of playing Wirtz clear, but hesitates and that particular opportunity is gone. The ball’s shifted right for Frimpong, who can’t find anyone with a low cross. Liverpool look good going forward, but the final-third confidence isn’t quite there. 24 min: Kerkez pulls the ball back instead of delivering the free kick into the box, and play’s shifted to the right, from where Szoboszlai crosses. As the aerial ball floats in, Konate is penalised for shoving an opponent to the ground. What a waste. 23 min: Gakpo sashays his way infield from the left, cutely chopping his way past a couple of players before being clipped by Torreira. The referee thinks about it for a while, then awards a free kick in a dangerous position. Kerkez to take. 22 min: Liverpool continue to play it patiently around the back. The home fans continue to whistle and jeer. Pantomime season soon! 20 min: There were 23 seconds between Sanchez’s off-the-line clearance from Gravenberch’s shot, and the award of the penalty. 18 min: That’s a wretched start for Szoboszlai, who has been left for dust twice already by Yilmaz, and given away a penalty kick. Galatasaray causing him problems where Arsenal could not. Osimhen runs up to the ball … stops … performs the tippy toes … then whips a shot down the middle, Alisson having finally committed himself. Clinical! 14 min: Ekitike is sent scampering clear down the middle. He whiffs his shot when one on one with the keeper. Or maybe a fluffed attempt to round the stopper. Either way, the ball breaks to Gakpo, who tries to slam the loose ball home. The shot’s cleared off the line by Sanchez. Wirtz tries to tee up Ekitike again, but misplaces the pass. The hosts break through Yilmaz, who enters the box down the left … then goes over when feeling Szoboszlai’s arm flap into his face. Penalty! 12 min: Gravenberch looks to spin Lemina and is wrestled down by the Galatasaray midfielder. Had it been later in the match, Lemina’s surely getting booked, but the referee stops short of that, simply dealing out a lecture. 10 min: Liverpool seem more than happy to draw the whistles. Some patient possession at the back irritates the crowd some more. Then Jones has the opportunity to release Ekitiké down the middle, but misplaces the pass. Ekitiké waves his appreciation for the intent, nonetheless. 8 min: Gakpo crosses from the left. Ekitiké can’t get his header on target. Meanwhile Richard Hirst writes: “The highlight of Buruk’s goal was seeing Fulham legend (he scored in a 3-1 victory at Old Trafford, so he qualifies) Junichi Inamoto flitting across the screen. Loved him.” 7 min: Frimpong has been super busy down the right. Now he crosses hoping again to find Ekitiké, but Sanchez hacks clear from his six-yard box. A lot of whistling from the home support as the visitors enjoy a bit of possession in the Gala half. 5 min: Liverpool go up the other end and win another corner, Frimpong nearly finding Ekitiké from the right. Szoboszlai slaps the corner into the first man. We could easily have had a couple of goals already. 3 min: Yilmaz tears past Szoboszlai down the inside-left channel with such ease! He enters the box ahead of everyone else and waits for Alisson to commit himself. The keeper spreads himself big to block out for a corner. What a save! Nothing comes of the resulting set piece. But that was nearly the fastest of starts for Galatasaray. 2 min: Konate wins a header at the near post, but can’t direct it goalwards. The ball clanks harmlessly wide. 1 min: Liverpool have stationed Szoboszlai at right back, with Frimpong up in Salah’s usual position … and the latter wins a corner after 49 seconds. The former to take. Liverpool huddle, the Gala fans whistle their displeasure, and then the visitors get the ball rolling. Roar! Growl! Bedlam! The teams are out! And it’s not exactly earth-shattering news to tell you that there’s a planet-bothering noise being made at the Ali Sami Yen. What an atmosphere! Galatasaray are wearing their red-and-yellow parçalı (segmented) shirts. Liverpool are in bottle green, a colour that will give fans of a certain generation guaranteed ice-cold pulses down the spine should they visualise three thick white stripes creeping over the right shoulder. We’ll be off in a couple of minutes. Jeremie Frimpong, the man stepping into Mohamed Salah’s shoes this evening, talks to Amazon. “It’s my first time over here … the atmosphere looks crazy … [Galatasaray] are a great team … we come here to win … we don’t want to lose … we want to put on a good performance … everybody feels like we have to perform … football is my happy place.” Liverpool boss Arne Slot turns up for a chat with Amazon, just about making himself heard over a PA system cranking out banger after banger. “It’s always special to come into a stadium where the fans are already there … these are the stadiums you want to play in … though I’m not playing it’s still nice to be part of it!” Of the spectacular firework show put on by fans outside Liverpool’s digs last night: “Maybe I was in the back of the hotel but I didn’t hear it … or I slept really well!” Then onto his team selection: “Jeremie [Frimpong] is not playing as a full-back, he is playing on the right wing … we have many games to play in a few days … there is another big game coming up [in the Premier League at Chelsea] … in many of our games, players have impacted the games coming off the bench … Mo scored three coming off the bench against Rangers … and I know who was the manager of Rangers back then, my current assistant Gio [van Bronckhorst] … so I know about this already!” As for his side’s defensive issues: “Most of the reasons we conceded chances were only partly to do with our defence … it’s not picking up second balls … conceding chances from set pieces … losing balls in positions when you shouldn’t lose it … it’s just as much the midfield and the front three … not aggressive in second balls, duels, set-pieces.” Slot also makes a long defence of his team’s current struggle with consistency of form, pointing out the big number of new signings who need to adapt, the players he has lost, and the amount of pre-season training missed by the likes of Alexander Isak, Alexis Mac Allister and Conor Bradley, among others. He caveats all of that by pointing out that Liverpool have so far lost only one game. Galatasaray manager Okan Buruk – who scored a pearler for the club in that aforementioned 3-2 win in 2006 – talks to Amazon Prime. First up, with Liverpool in town, he’s asked about a man with a foot in both camps, Graeme Souness, who you may remember doing this after the 1996 Turkish Cup final, which had been played on Gala’s Istanbul rival Fenerbahçe’s turf … “He’s a legend … it was a golden goal in extra time … he did an amazing thing with the flag … it was very dangerous … he is one of the most important coaches in Galatastaray history … I like him very much as a coach and a person!” Then on Buruk’s famous goal against Liverpool … “I scored an amazing goal … by chance I shot outside the box from a corner kick … always Galatasaray has good results against Liverpool and I hope they will today again.” And finally tonight’s team, led up front by Victor Osimhen. “First time after his injury, he played ten minutes of the Turkish league game … today he will start … he is very important for us … also Mauro Icardi is very important for us … I have two big strikers but very different types … I will start with Osimhen but continue with Mauro.” Galatasaray: Cakir, Singo, Sanchez, Bardakci, Jakobs, Lemina, Torreira, Akgun, Gundogan, Yilmaz, Osimhen. Subs: Guvenc, Baltaci, Sallai, Gabriel Sara, Icardi, Sane, Elmali, Kutlu, Kutucu, Ayhan, Demir, Unyay. Liverpool: Alisson, Frimpong, Konate, van Dijk, Kerkez, Gravenberch, Jones, Szoboszlai, Wirtz, Gakpo, Ekitike. Subs: Mamardashvili, Woodman, Gomez, Endo, Isak, Mac Allister, Salah, Bradley, Robertson, Ngumoha. Referee: Clement Turpin (Bourgogne). Liverpool make four changes to the XI that started (very poorly, it has to be said) the game at Palace last Saturday. Jeremie Frimpong comes in for Conor Bradley at right-back, Curtis Jones replaces Alexis Mac Allister in midfield, and Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak make way for Cody Gakpo and Hugo Ekitike up front. All the players stepping aside are named as subs. For the hosts, Victor Osimhen starts for the first time since returning from injury last weekend. Mauro Icardi is on the bench, alongside former Manchester City star Leroy Sané. Another former City favourite, İlkay Gündoğan, starts, as does erstwhile Southampton, Fulham and Wolves midfielder Mario Lemina, one-time Arsenal midfielder Lucas Torreira, and ex-Spurs defender Davinson Sánchez. Galatasaray lost their opening Champions League fixture 5-1 at Eintracht Frankfurt; Liverpool won theirs 3-2 at home to Atletico Madrid. On the other hand, Cimbom have won all seven of their Turkish Super Lig fixtures so far, while Liverpool have just lost their first Premier League game of the season, snapping a run of five wins, at Crystal Palace. And then Galatasaray have lost only three of their last 18 home European games, winning ten and drawing five, while Liverpool have won 13 of their last 14 Champions League group/league matches. So depending on which way you turn, there’s a stat that’ll make a good case for either team winning tonight. Something’s got to give. Draw? The last time Liverpool played Galatasaray away, in the Champions League group stage in December 2006, they sent out a team that featured Gabriel Paletta, Danny Guthrie and Lee Peltier. They lost 3-2, Robbie Fowler with both of their consolations. To be fair, it was a dead rubber, with Rafael Benitez’s team having already won their group, the Turkish side already knocked out, and Liverpool went on to reach the final. But that did happen. Liverpool’s only other game away at Galatasaray was also in the Champions League, in February 2002. They drew that one 1-1, Jari Litmanen setting up Emile Heskey, part of a campaign that looked highly promising until Gerard Houllier inexplicably took off Didi Hamann in the quarter-finals against Bayer Leverkusen … but that’s a topic for another day. Anyway, it all means Liverpool are still searching for their first away victory over Gala. Will that quest end tonight? We find out from 8pm UK time onwards. It’s on!"
"Bodø/Glimt 2-2 Tottenham, Chelsea 1-0 Benfica and more: Champions League – as it happened",https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/sep/30/chelsea-v-benfica-bodglimt-v-tottenham-and-more-champions-league-live,"Catch up on all the action with our reports from the Aspmyra Stadion, Stamford Bridge and Rams Park plus our Champions League roundup of the rest. And that concludes our live coverage tonight. Join us tomorrow for as Barcelona take on the holders, PSG, while Newcastle head to Union Saint-Gilloise, Arsenal host Olympiakos and Manchester City take on Monaco. José Mourinho speaks to TNT Sports after Benfica’s loss: We played four matches, two game in between matches. I have never trained. I just do recovery. One of my strengths is training, we haven’t had time for that … Some difficulties and big pressure on the players with elections at the club, they cannot escape that. We were organised, we studied Chelsea well. We coped well with the designs they put on the pitch. Cucurella in between the lines or out wide. And then a difficult moment with three midfielders on a yellow card in a match with quick transactions. Today, we did enough to get a point and we must now find points elsewhere. As a coach that arrived 10 days ago it is a positive feeling. But the next two matches: Porto away and Newcastle away. It is what it is. I told the guys that Chelsea is better than Porto. The boys did OK. Sheffield United 1-2 Southampton: The Blades’s manager Chris Wilder was sent off after booting a ball into the crowd (in reaction to his side conceding a penalty which Southampton ended up missing) and hitting one of his own supporters. He went to apologise but he was shown a red regardless. The visitors came from behind to win all three points after Ross Stewart’s scored in the 51st and 58th minute. Championship Birmingham 2-2 Sheffield Wednesday Blackburn 1-2 Swansea Bristol City 1-1 Ipswich Hull 2-2 Preston North End Leicester 1-1 Wrexham Middlesbrough 0-0 Stoke Sheffield United 1-2 Southampton Derby 1-1 Charlton League One Blackpool 2-2 Luton Cardiff 0-1 Burton Albion Bodø/Glimt 2-2 Spurs: Frank’s side will be thanking their lucky stars. They were outclassed for most of the match but another late equaliser, an own goal, secured the visitors a point. It will be disappointing for Bodø/Glimt after tremendous goals from Hauge the home town hero. Chelsea 1-0 Benfica: Mourinho’s homecoming ends in defeat after an own goal from Ríos in the first half. It is a very important win for Maresca’s side, who have struggled as of late. It was crucial for them to grind out the win after going ahead and luckily for the hosts, João Pedro’s red card came too close to full-time to make a significant difference on the game. Chelsea 1-0 Benfica Bodø/Glimt 2-2 Spurs Galatasaray 1-0 Liverpool Atlético Madrid 5-1 Eintracht Frankfurt Pafos 1-5 Bayern Munich Inter 3-0 Slavia Prague Marseille 4-0 Ajax Three out of four games in which a Chelsea player gets sent off. João Pedro, who came on in the second half, is shown a second yellow for a high boot. Chelsea 1-0 Benfica: A yellow card is shown towards the direction of the Benfica bench … Uefa confirm it is to Mourinho. Classic. Bodø Glimt 2-2 Spurs: After a very long VAR check, the goal stands! Big goal for the visitors. Richarlison has barely had a kick of the ball but he gets their equaliser. Gray has a shot that is saved and it is ricocheted off of either the Brazilian or the defender Gundersen … but another VAR check. Was there an offside? Bodø Glimt 2-1 Spurs: Great play from the visitors as they counter after a Spurs corner that ends with Helmersen hitting the woodwork. That is their 16th attempt on the Tottenham goal tonight. Worrying stat for Frank. Bodø Glimt 2-1 Spurs: Odobert hits the post after diving on to head Kudus’s cross. So close! An absolute hammering in the Spanish capital. Amenda is judged to have committed a foul after a VAR check and Alvarez makes no mistake from the spot despite Santos getting a hand on his paneka. Chelsea 1-0 Benfica: Mourinho makes three substitutions. Schjelderup, Ivanovic and Leandro Barreiro come on. Chelsea breaks and Fernández puts a great ball in for Estêvão, who heads it goalwards. Trubin is full stretch as he jumps and tips it over the bar. So close! Chelsea 1-0 Benfica: The whistle blows after João Pedro fouls Otamendi but the replay shows the defender going down and holding his face. João Pedro did not touch his face. Chelsea 1-0 Benfica: The medics are on the pitch for Silva, who was caught by Trubin on the back of the head. He is up on his feet but he will be substituted off for Araújo. Atlético Madrid and Bayern are running away with wins, the former having just scored through Simeone (their forward not their manager) to make it 4-1 while the German giants are 5-1 up after Olise fired into the roof of the net, having earlier assisted twice. It is not over until it is over. A fantastic cross from Porro finds Van de Ven, whose fantastic header is fired into the back of the net. Can Frank’s side kick on now? What a finish! Great little turn and on to his right foot before smashing it past Vicario. A home town hero. But so poor from Spurs who lost the ball moments earlier. Chelsea 1-0 Benfica: Gittens, who came on a few minutes ago alongside João Pedro dribbles past a few red shirts but his cross to the right is slightly overhit. Bodø Glimt 1-0 Spurs: Spurs win a set-piece in a dangerous area … Porro slams it into the box and Bentancur tries to get it goalward but it is cleared. Some more goals went in during that VAR drama. Marseille are 4-0 up after Aubameyang goes from provider to goalscorer and Burkardt has smashed one in for Frankfurt. Huge cheer as the referee rules that there is no goal. Van de Ven is furious. He is judged to have fouled Bjørtuft by pulling his shirt. Moments later the Spurs captain gets a yellow card for another foul, this time on Auklend. He needs to keep his head here. Spurs immediately respond! It is from a set piece and the hosts are caught sleeping. Johnson gets the ball back into the area after it is half cleared and Bentancur flicks it in. But here we go … a VAR check. The referee heads to the screen. It has been coming! Bodø Glimt have their first ever goal in the Champions League and what a finish from Hague. On the left, he skips past a few Spurs shirts and then curls one into the net. Huge noise from the yellow-donning supporters. Hague was born and raised in the city and played every minute of their European campaign last season. What a moment for him. Bodø Glimt 0-0 Spurs: The home fans cheer as Spence miscontrols a ball that goes out. Very indicative of their performance so far. Chelsea 1-0 Benfica: The visitors come close! Aursnes is through on goal from the left hand side but he is tripped over by Sánchez. He was judged to be in an offside position anyway. Chelsea 1-0 Benfica: An early yellow card for Buonanotte thought the replay shows he did get the ball before Barrenechea did. The commentators are saying Fernández – who is also on a yellow – was cautioned by the referee to “be careful” in the second half. We are back underway across the grounds! More goals? Yes, please! Half-time: I missed a couple goals during a massive rush. Griezmann scored Atlético’s third, his 200th for the club, but it was all made possible due to Alvarez, who beat his man on the left before picking out Griezmann to finish it. Inter are 2-0 up with their second coming from Dumfries. Thuram found the full-back and all he needed to do was poke it home at the near post. Bayern are 4-1 up at Pafos, with Kane scoring his second shortly after Jackson scored his first goal for the club. The hosts got one back on the brink of half-time with a sensational top corner shot from Mislav Orsic, who managed to wrongfoot Neuer. And in the Football League, with Jeremy getting in touch to tell me the Championship is “SERIOUS”. Hard agree. But hard to keep up with on a European night. Championship Birmingham 1-1 Sheffield Wednesday Blackburn 1-1 Swansea Bristol City 1-0 Ipswich Hull 1-2 Preston North End Leicester 1-0 Wrexham Middlesbrough 0-0 Stoke Sheffield United 1-0 Southampton Derby 0-1 Charlton League One Blackpool 1-0 Luton Cardiff 0-0 Burton Albion Chelsea 1-0 Benfica Bodø/Glimt 0-0 Spurs Galatasaray 1-0 Liverpool Atlético Madrid 3-0 Eintracht Frankfurt Pafos 1-4 Bayern Munich Inter 2-0 Slavia Prague Marseille 3-0 Ajax Bodø Glimt 0-0 Spurs: Hague hits the side netting from a low effort after cutting inside. Fet then almost gets the opener after skying a chance from just outside the six-yard box. Spurs getting lucky here. Chelsea 1-0 Benfica: A well-worked free-kick routine that lands to Badiashile but his header goes over the bar. The offside flag saves his blushes as he probably should do better from that chance. Chelsea 1-0 Benfica: Fernández goes over for a corner kick and he applauds the Benfica fans – the midfielder played there for half a season – but the feeling is not reciprocated. The fans start chucking things his way and Mourinho is forced to walk down the touchline to tell the supporters to stop. The corner leads to nothing. The defender is the quickest to react at the back post after Antoinne Griezmann has his flick saved by the goalkeeper. A dominant performance from the Spanish club after their 5-2 hammering of Real Madrid at the weekend. Huge let-off for Tottenham! Bentancur concedes a penalty for a follow-through on Bjørkan that is confirmed by VAR. Høgh steps up and sends his spot-kick wildly over the bar. So poor! The Inter captain has had a handful of chances and he finally makes one count. He does not let his misses get to him as he presses Stanek. The keeper has a howler, passing it straight to the striker, who scores into an open net. Chelsea 0-0 Benfica: Before kick-off, Mourinho was blowing kisses to the Chelsea faithful who were chanting his name. Now he has a very serious look on his face as he directs Pavlidis up the pitch. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang gets his second assist of the night as the hosts cruise in the first half. Bodø/Glimt 0-0 Spurs: Tottenham are surprisingly sitting deep and struggling to get out of their own half. But they’re keeping their defensive shape well. The hosts have had 70% possession but only one chance on target. Olise is again involved, working the ball from the right before a quick give-and-go between Guerreiro and Jackson. The defender then smoothly slots into the back of the net. A good cross from the right finds Garnacho after a good run into the box and the former Manchester United forward hits into the box. It smashes against Ríos and straight into the net. Chelsea 0-0 Benfica: Neto has George at the edge of the box but he opts to go for goal after cutting inside on the right and it is a good effort – just wide! Who else?! The English striker continues his fine form in Cyprus, scoring after linking up with Olise moments after hitting the woodwork. Another for the Brazilian! Ajax are an absolute mess at the back! The lose the ball near their own box and Paixão’s long range shot doubles the score. Chelsea 0-0 Benfica: George, who is starting up front in a somewhat unfamiliar position, is making good runs but is not getting much of the ball from his teammates. Meanwhile, the ball lands to Garnacho after some good work on the right hand side but his bouncing half-volley is wide. Chelsea 0-0 Benfica: A poor ball from Cucurella which lands to Lukébakio but the Belgian can only hit the post. Warning signs for Chelsea’s defence. Some great quick passing from the hosts before a well-timed run from Paixão. He is essentially 1v1 with the keeper and fires a low shot at the near post. Chelsea 0-0 Benfica: The Benfica fans are in full voice but it is Chelsea who have started well. Fernández has a go from outside the box but it is just wide. The hosts find an early lead! Giuliano Simeone does well on the right before hitting a low cross to Giacomo Raspadori who fires it home. Bodø/Glimt 0-0 Spurs: The visitors win an early free kick. Porro whips it to the far post but it is dealt with by the hosts and goes out for a goal kick. Chelsea 0-0 Benfica: Mourinho and Maresca shared a long chat in the tunnel at Stamford Bridge. A manager making his Champions League debut this season against a two-time winner. Kick-offs in the late Champions League games. Here we go! Chelsea 0-0 Benfica Bodø/Glimt 0-0 Spurs Galatasaray 0-0 Liverpool Atlético Madrid 0-0 Eintracht Frankfurt Pafos 0-0 Bayern Munich Inter 0-0 Slavia Prague Marseille 0-0 Ajax Full-time in the early Champions League kick-offs. Kairat 0-5 Real Madrid: A Kylian Mbappé hat-trick plus goals from Eduardo Camavinga and Brahim Díaz give the visitors an emphatic yet expected win. Atalanta 2-1 Club Brugge: After a much-better showing in the second-half, Lazar Samardzic’s penalty and Mario Pasalic’s header helped the hosts come from behind to secure victory. Some of your thoughts have landed in the postbag as we approach the late kick-offs. Jeremy knows what to expect from today: Yeah, OK, looking forward to Liverpool scoring/conceding a stoppage time winner, to Spurs grinding out a draw in the Arctic Circle with their soft-southerner gloves and tights on, but obviously all eyes are on Stamford Bridge, just as The Special/Mellow/Sacked one would like it. He had us all fooled for a while, taking it all on his heavily stubbled chin to allow the players space to express themselves. But actually it was all up there to see long before. Where were the cameras for his Porto period Old Trafford knee-slide? Goalscorer? Assister? JoseKneeSlide? What on earth have Benfica done putting him on the payroll? Graham Potter is available, is it too late? It all feels a bit like this. And Krishna with an eye-catching prediction: A club that has won all the European cups (CL, EL and the new CL) meets its former boss who has also won all the three cups as a manager. I expect decorum to last till half-time after which the special one will poke Maresca in the eye. Liverpool are at Galatasaray and Arne Slot has left a couple big names on the bench. Follow along with Scott Murray in our minute-by-minute report. Real Madrid are up 3-0 in Kazakhstan, with Kylian Mbappé scoring a penalty before netting two in the second-half. The hosts were doing well to fend off the Spanish giants but inexperience cost Kairat with their 18-year-old goalkeeper Sherkhan Kalmurza made a silly foul in the box on Franco Mastantuono. The Kazakhstani keeper saved a spot-kick against Sporting in their first Champions League match but could not do the same against Mbappé. His second came after Thibaut Courtois caught the hosts’ defence sleeping. Mbappé latched onto the keepers long ball before lifting it over Kalmurza. The Frenchman’s hat-trick was rounded out with a laser shot into the bottom corner. Club Brugge led at Atalanta after a curling finish from Christos Tzolis. That is now two goals and four assists in six Champions League matches this season (includes qualifying). But the hosts bounced back after VAR confirmed a penalty, Lazar Samardzic pulling one back. Bayern head to the coasts of Cyprus to take on Pafos and Harry Kane will be keen to add to his Champions League goal tally. He has scored eight goals in his last eight Champions League appearances and is now one of only three players with 20+ goals scored for two different clubs, joining Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar. The striker has also scored a century of goals for the club in record time and, somehow, Bayern and Kane is a combination that just makes sense. Here is more from Andy Brassell. Bodø/Glimt (4-3-3): Haikin; Sjøvold, Bjørtuft, Aleesami, Bjørkan; Evjen, Berg, Brunstad Fet; Auklend, Høgh, Hauge Subs: Lund, Sjong, Nielsen, Gundersen, Blomberg, Helmersen, Klynge, Riisnaes, Määttä, Jørgensen, Hansen Spurs (4-3-3): Vicario; Spence, Danso, Van de Ven, Porro; Sarr, Bergvall, Bentancur; Johnson, Richarlison, Odobert Subs: Kinský, Austin, Palhinha, Simons, Udogie, Gray, Kudus, Davies, Scarlett, Olusesi, Hardy Referee: Ivan Kruzliak (Slovakia) Chelsea (4-2-3-1): Sánchez; Gusto, Chalobah, Badiashile, Cucurella; Caicedo, Fernández; Neto, Buonanotte, Garnacho; George Subs: Jørgensen, Merrick, Gittens, João Pedro, Hato, James, Acheampong, Guiu, Estêvão, Lavia, Walsh Benfica (4-2-3-1): Trubin; Dedić, Otamendi, António Silva, Dahl; Barrenechea, Ríos; Lukébakio, Aursnes, Sudakov; Pavlidis Subs: Ferreira, Soares, Obrador, Ivanović, Barreiro, Schjelderup, H Araújo, T Araújo, Oliveira, Veloso, Rego, Prioste Referee: Daniel Siebert (Germany) Farther north, Thomas Frank will hope his side can find a creative spark, something they have lacked since the start of the season. While they lie fourth in the Premier League, they are ninth for chance creation. Last year, most of the games, it was [Dejan] Kulusevski, [James] Maddison, Sonny [Heung-min] and Dom[inic Solanke] who played. Now we have more or less a new front four and they are doing very well. Maybe we are creating more chances, dominating a bit more. All the right signs are there. Read more from Frank and the task at hand in Bodø from Jonathan Wilson. Check out the always-funny David Squires on Mourinho’s homecoming before watching the Portuguese describe in his own words his special connection with Chelsea. José Mourinho made his name in European football when he followed up a 2002-03 Uefa Cup success at Porto with a historic Champions League win the next season. He went on to lift league titles with Chelsea, Inter and Real Madrid and a second Champions League with the Nerazzurri. The Portuguese legend more recently won the Europa League with Manchester United and completed a clean sweep of the major Uefa club trophies by steering Roma to Conference League glory. Now he is back at Benfica, the club where, for a few months in 2000, he took his first senior coaching role. He faces a Chelsea that is much changed from his days as manager. Enzo Maresca has had an tumultuous tenure so far, with Conference League and Club World Cup highs and injury-woes and in-game management lows. While the comparison with Mourinho’s glory days will be clear, the Stamford Bridge hierarchy firmly believe in their current man and he must use his squad if he wants to win over Mourinho today. How things stand in the Champions League league phase table after the first games. And here is a refresher on who stood out in matchday one. Hint: Marcus Rashford and PSG. José Mourinho is back in west London. The Special One™ returns to Chelsea today with an abundance of memories that swirl around him in his introduction to English football. With three Premier League titles to his name at Stamford Bridge, Mourinho claims he remains the club’s best manager. But he will have his work cut out for him. Benfica are without a win in their last seven Uefa competition games against English teams, their most recent being a 3-1 away victory against Tottenham in the 2013-14 Europa League round of 16. Plus the Portuguese is winless in his past seven against Chelsea. Can he cause an upset with Benfica today? And will we get a revival of his greatest hits on the touchline? That is, of course, not all in this jam-packed matchday 2 of the Champions League league phase. Two all-time Champions League/European Cup geography records will be broken today as Thomas Frank’s Tottenham head north of the Arctic Circle to face Bodø/Glimt in the competition’s most northerly match ever. And Real Madrid are 30 minutes into their match against Kazakhstan’s Kairat Almaty, the competition’s most easterly match. Meanwhile, Atlético Madrid host Eintracht Frankfurt while Ajax head to Marseille. Plus action in the Championship and League One includes Leicester v Wrexham, Bristol v Ipswich and Blackpool v Luton. Champions League Atalanta 0-0 Club Brugge Kairat Almaty 0-1 Real Madrid Pafos v Bayern Munich Atlético Madrid v Eintracht Frankfurt Bodø/Glimt v Spurs Chelsea v Benfica Inter v Slavia Prague Marseille v Ajax Galatasaray v Liverpool Championship Birmingham v Sheffield Wednesday Blackburn v Swansea Bristol City v Ipswich Hull v Preston North End Leicester v Wrexham Middlesbrough v Stoke Sheffield United v Southampton Derby v Charlton League One Blackpool v Luton Cardiff v Burton Albion Phew!

Late own goal rescues point for Spurs at Bodø/Glimt after Hauge double,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/30/bodo-glimt-tottenham-champions-league-match-report,"These are strange times for Tottenham. Historically they have often been a side whose performances did not match their results, but tradition has it they would be pretty and ineffective. Under Thomas Frank they have become the opposite. Midway through the second half Spurs were 2-0 down and apparently on their way to a convincing defeat. They rode their luck as Andreas Helmersen hit the bar with an effort that would have made it 3-1, but they had the character to battle back and secure a 2-2 draw. Doggedness and resilience have not been stereotypical Spurs qualities. Bodø/Glimt’s fans seemed happy enough at the end, serenading their players – and perhaps there was a sense of Tottenham’s greater quality telling – but this was a game they could have won with ease. “We showed big character to fight back,” Frank said. “It’s hugely important that they have that to keep running, keep fighting, to do the right thing. We kept moving the ball, kept creating chances from wide. Until 2-0 they were the better team but after that we got on top.” It was the third time in four games that Spurs have conceded the opening goal of the game, but Frank believes that is coincidence. Only in this match did he accept that Tottenham had “struggled” early on, insisting that against both Brighton and Wolves, Spurs had conceded against the run of play. That was emphatically not the case here. “On the ball I felt we could and should have kept the ball better,” Frank said, something he blamed on a lack of both structure and willingness to be bold. “A little bit on the day where you just need better touches, better decisions, better passes.” Perhaps missing the leadership of Cristian Romero, left in London as a precaution, Tottenham never imposed themselves physically as they had in beating Bodø/Glimt in the Europa League semi-final in May. Here the home side had their chances before a late challenge from Rodrigo Bentancur on Fredrik André Bjørkan conceded a 32nd-minute penalty. Presented with a historic chance, though, Kasper Høgh smashed his shot so high over the bar that it cleared the seating behind the goal and might even have cleared the tiled roofs of the houses across the street had there not been a net strung between the flagpoles at the top of the stand. It was Bodø/Glimt’s first home game in the group phase of the Champions League, and they were determined to make the most of it. The pre-match singing of the club anthem was heartfelt and gently moving, and followed by the rhythmic detonation of a series of fireworks, startlingly loud in the still Arctic night. European football has little place these days for romance but Glimt remain an example of what can be achieved by enlightened leadership even in a remote town of just over 50,000 population. They may have won four of the past five Norwegian championships, and be handily placed as this season’s title race enters the run-in, but this is not a club that has become sated by silverware. In the 1980s, as they slid into the third flight, Glimt were not even the biggest team in Bodø, that honour belonging to Grand. Back then their main claim to fame was the forward slash in their name, introduced to avoid the confusion their hyphen caused on betting coupons. The hyphen itself was a product of Glimt adding Bodø to their name in 1948 so they would not be mixed up with a similarly named club from Trøndelag. All around town, among the clapboard houses and along the dockside, yellow Glimt flags could be seen, while the mood was simultaneously welcoming and disbelieving. This is still a club for whom playing in the Champions League is a privilege. The honour of scoring their first home goal in the group phase went to a homegrown talent in Jens Petter Hauge, albeit he has had spells away at Milan and Eintracht Frankfurt, where he became the first Norwegian to win the Europa League. Drifting in from the left, he was a persistent menace, both goals highlighting his balance and technical quality. Nikita Haikin, the Glimt goalkeeper, had pointed out how “unusual” it was that Spurs focus so much on set plays and for a long time that did appear their only threat. Bentancur seemed to have levelled two minutes after the Glimt opener, as the ball was returned to the centre after a Pedro Porro free-kick had hit the post; it was ruled out after a VAR review for a pull by Micky van de Ven. Spurs did score two minutes after Glimt’s second, Van de Ven heading in another Porro free-kick. Wilson Odobert headed a Mohammed Kudus delivery against the crossbar but the equaliser did arrive in the 89th minute as Archie Gray’s shot ricocheted in off Jostein Gundersen, the fourth own goal from which Spurs have benefited this season. Deserved? Perhaps not, but when has that ever mattered?"
Victor Osimhen fires Galatasaray to victory on hellish night for Liverpool,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/30/galatasaray-liverpool-champions-league-match-report,"Reigning Premier League champions and league leaders may be held to higher standards than most, but cause for concern in Liverpool is justified. Arne Slot presided over back‑to‑back defeats for only the second time in his Liverpool tenure as Galatasaray triumphed on a raucous night in Istanbul. The performance should trouble Liverpool’s head coach more than the result. Liverpool were sloppy, again, suspect defensively, again, and short on ideas as they succumbed to Victor Osimhen’s first-half penalty. Defeat would have been heavier had the Galatasaray striker not squandered two clear openings early in the second half but was deserved nonetheless. The visitors were almost reprieved by the award of an 89th‑minute penalty but even that did not go their way. The referee, Clément Turpin, overturned his decision to penalise Wilfried Singo for a foul on Ibrahima Konaté – the Galatasaray defender played the ball first – after reviewing the incident on the pitchside monitor. Slot defended Liverpool’s performance along with his decision to rest Mohamed Salah until the 62nd minute. He also blamed a disjointed second half on Galatasaray’s tendency to go down at the slightest touch. Defeat, however, was largely self-inflicted. It was a surprise to see Salah on the bench for such a high‑profile European occasion even taking into account his modest start to the season and recent workload. Alexander Isak, Alexis Mac Allister and Conor Bradley were also benched as Slot made four changes from the side beaten at Crystal Palace on Saturday. Jeremie Frimpong took Salah’s place with Dominik Szoboszlai stationed behind him at right-back again. The Hungary midfielder came in for a testing night against the pace of Baris Alper Yilmaz. The same could be said of the entire Liverpool team in the first half as Galatasaray embraced the occasion. Rams Park, or Ali Sami Yen Spor Kompleksi to give Galatasaray’s home their unsponsored name, pulsated with noise 45 minutes before kick‑off. Incessant, deafening whistles greeted every Liverpool touch after it. There was also a classy moment at kick-off when a tribute to Diogo Jota was displayed on the giant screen and the digital hoardings around the arena. Okan Buruk’s team have made a 100% start to the Super Lig season as they pursue a fourth consecutive Turkish league title but domestic dominance has not transferred into European competition often. This was only Galatasaray’s second win in 19 Champions League group games, coming off the back of a 5-1 trouncing at Eintracht Frankfurt on the opening night, and it seemed the entire club – players to fanbase – were determined to make amends. Yilmaz scorched past Szoboszlai at Galatasaray’s first attack. The forward was through on goal but, as at Selhurst Park, Alisson stood his ground well to make an important block. There would be no reprieve for Liverpool’s makeshift full-back when Yilmaz next ran at him. Hugo Ekitiké steered a free header wide from Cody Gakpo’s cross as the visitors attempted to silence the din. Gakpo created another opening for Ekitiké when slipping him through with a neat pass. Ugurcan Cakir stood tall and saved with his legs only for the rebound to fall to Gakpo. His volley was blocked on the line by Ismail Jakobs and 25 seconds later, after Florian Wirtz had squandered possession with an over-elaborate back-heel, Galatasaray were awarded a penalty. The hosts broke through Ilkay Gündogan and Yilmaz, who again attacked Szoboszlai from the left and cut back inside the defender before collapsing to the ground. Yilmaz was caught in the face by Szoboszlai’s trailing hand – it was more of a stroke of the stubble than a proper slap – but Turpin pointed immediately to the spot. Osimhen drilled the spot-kick straight down the centre of Alisson’s goal. Liverpool dominated possession and outnumbered the Galatasaray defence on several counterattacks without creating a clear opportunity. Cakir saved from Wirtz at close range, desperate defending prevented Ekitiké and Milos Kerkez converting at the resulting corner, and Konaté headed wide at the near post. But Slot’s side were unconvincing at the back and almost punished again when Osimhen dispossessed Ryan Gravenberch before being tripped by the midfielder just outside the Liverpool area. The £65m striker felt he was denied a clear goalscoring opportunity but Gravenberch was punished with a yellow card. Osimhen, a disruptive force all night, was gifted a chance to double the hosts’ lead when he dispossessed Curtis Jones and burst through on goal. Jones atoned with a superb challenge. A mix-up between Konaté and Gravenberch offered Osimhen another opening but he shot tamely at Alisson. The Liverpool keeper was injured in the process and had to be replaced by Giorgi Mamardashvili. Alisson’s replacement was hardly troubled once Osimhen departed with an injury. Neither was Cakir, despite Liverpool penning Galatasaray in during the closing stages. Another unconvincing display for Slot to digest."
No happy Chelsea return for José Mourinho as own goal sinks Benfica,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/30/chelsea-benfica-champions-league-match-report,"The days when José Mourinho would arrive in town with more to offer than touchline showmanship have long passed. The 62-year-old’s time at the top of the coaching tree belongs to a different era and, for all the nostalgia about Mourinho’s trophy-laden spells at Chelsea before this game, the main takeaway from his return to Stamford Bridge is that this is a manager who no longer gets job offers from Europe’s biggest teams. The buildup was more entertaining than the actual football. Chelsea, carrying injuries and a long way below their best, were comfortable against Mourinho’s tepid Benfica. They dug out a 1-0 win, a messy own goal the difference on a night that did not feel like a good advert for the extended Champions League, and for 95 minutes the job was done so efficiently it almost could have passed as a tribute to Mourinho’s pomp. Chelsea being Chelsea, though, there still had to be complications as they edged towards their first win of the league phase. They were into the sixth minute of added time when João Pedro, on as a second‑half substitute, picked up a second yellow for a clumsy foul. Rashness still plagues Enzo Maresca’s young side. They have received three red cards in as many games and it is not ideal that João Pedro will be suspended for the home game against Ajax given that injuries to Liam Delap and Cole Palmer have already left Chelsea short up front. Maresca will shuffle through his squad for options. This was a moment to rotate and rest weary limbs. There were rare starts for Alejandro Garnacho, Facundo Buonanotte and Tyrique George in attack. Maresca liked Garnacho’s performance but this was not wholly convincing. Jamie Gittens was quiet during his cameo. Estêvão was bright after coming on, almost scoring a late header. Application was not the issue. It was more that Chelsea are missing some big players, are not at their physical peak and are simply not clicking at the moment. At least they avoided a stumble on their trip down memory lane. The narrative about how Mourinho’s return would show how standards have dropped since Roman Abramovich’s departure never materialised. The Mourinho of 2025, after all, is not in charge of one of the Champions League’s giants. Benfica, who have lost their first two games of the league phase, were a blunt proposition. Chelsea held them at arm’s length. A couple of late scares will not stop Maresca from dwelling on the positives. Under pressure after a poor run, Chelsea showed resolve to respond to losing against Bayern Munich in the opening week of fixtures. The defending was solid enough to raise hope for tougher assignments. Chelsea, without offering much excitement, delivered. They will look to raise their level again when Liverpool visit on Saturday. Dealing with the Mourinho show will lift morale. Maresca is yet to inspire as much warmth as his predecessor. The mood has been tense, the memory of Club World Cup glory in danger of fading already. Maresca needed a response. He made five changes after Brighton handed Chelsea their second consecutive league defeat last Saturday. The starting XI, though, was raw. It was unsurprising that Chelsea made a nervy start. Benfica could have led after eight minutes, a Marc Cucurella error leading to Robert Sánchez pushing Dodi Lukébakio’s shot against a post. Chelsea were loose. Benfica were emboldened. Richard Ríos tested Sánchez again. Sensing the anxiety, Maresca called for calm when Benoît Badiashile rushed a long pass out of play. Chelsea stirred. Pedro Neto, one of their more experienced players, took over. The winger threatened with a rasping effort and was involved when Chelsea went ahead. It was the kind of goal a vintage Mourinho team never would have conceded. Neto delivered a deep cross from the right. Garnacho ghosted in unnoticed and saw Ríos turn his cutback into his own net under little pressure. The frustration for Mourinho, who returned to Benfica two weeks ago, was that Chelsea were short of incision. But this is by no means a great Benfica team. They are third in the Primeira Liga and there is doubt over whether Rui Costa will be re‑elected president this month. Benfica were bland, unrecognisable, Lukébakio the sole inspiration in attack. George could have made it 2-0 to Chelsea. It was tight. Benfica pushed at the start of the second half. Maresca saw the shift. He took the blame for making poor substitutions when Chelsea were down to 10 during their defeats against Brighton and Manchester United. This time he was positive, Estêvão on for Buonanotte before the hour. Mourinho waited in vain for Benfica to rally, João Pedro’s dismissal changing nothing. Trevoh Chalobah and Badiashile, making his first start since injuring himself against these opponents in the last 16 of the Club World Cup, were solid in central defence. For Maresca, of course, the worry is that Chalobah misses the Liverpool game through suspension. Badiashile’s return is timely but injuries have left Chelsea stretched at the back. Concerns over Badiashile’s partner against Liverpool linger. For now, though, Maresca will take the win and move on."
Uefa puts Israel vote on hold after Donald Trump’s proposed peace plan,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/30/uefa-put-israel-vote-on-hold-due-to-donald-trumps-proposed-peace-plan,"Uefa has paused plans to ban Israel from European football after the announcement of Donald Trump’s proposed peace plan for the region. Expectation had been growing of a decisive intervention by Uefa this week, amid growing pressure within football and from outside groups, including the United Nations. But Trump’s announcement of his plan in a joint press conference with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Monday put any measures on hold. Uefa never officially confirmed that it was considering an extraordinary meeting of its executive committee to vote on whether to exclude Israel from its competitions, but plans on the proposal were understood to be well developed, with any meeting expected to have been called at short notice. National federations who had been supportive of a ban accepted the decision to pause, with sources saying it would be “stupid” for Uefa to take individual action while collective peace efforts are under way. That position may be revisited if there is not agreement over the Trump deal, with Trump saying on Tuesday that Hamas had “three or four days” to accept his proposals. Last week a group of senior diplomats last week called on Uefa and Fifa to enact a ban after the publication of a report by the UN independent international commission of inquiry that found Israel was committing genocide in Gaza. A fortnight ago the campaign group Game Over Israel took over a billboard in New York’s Times Square to urge federations to boycott matches with the country. The announcement of the Trump plan has swung the pendulum again, with the proposal welcomed by Keir Starmer on Tuesday alongside leaders from France and Germany among other European nations. It has also been backed by the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Indonesia and Pakistan, whose foreign ministers relayed their support in a statement. The last remaining Israeli side in European club competition, Maccabi Tel Aviv, are due to face Dinamo Zagreb in the Europa League on Thursday night. Israel are scheduled to play Norway on 11 October and Italy three days later in World Cup qualifying."
"Rodri still cannot cope with playing three games a week, says Pep Guardiola",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/30/rodri-still-cannot-cope-with-playing-three-games-a-week-says-pep-guardiola,"Rodri is not able to cope with the demands of Manchester City’s rigorous schedule as he continues his comeback from a cruciate ligament injury, according to Pep Guardiola. The Spanish midfielder missed the 5-1 win against Burnley on Saturday after stating he was not fit but will be available to face Monaco on Wednesday in the Champions League. City’s form collapsed last season after Rodri sustained the injury against Arsenal a year ago. Guardiola is wary of overloading him at this stage and putting the midfielder at risk of the problem recurring. “He is not injured but in the tendon he has a difficulty,” Guardiola said. “The week before was so demanding with [Manchester] United, Napoli and especially Arsenal and right now he’s not able to play three games in a week at a top, top, top level – top intensity, demanding opponents. “My feeling right now is he is not ready because he needs time. This type of injury, it is minimum one year and after that you start. Be patient and he dictates. If he feels not good, it’s better to rest.” City, who began their Champions League campaign with victory against Napoli, will be led out by the former Monaco midfielder Bernardo Silva who was appointed captain this summer after Kevin De Bruyne’s exit. “Man City was so successful in the last eight years not because one captain was really good but because we have a group of great leaders,” Silva said. “Obviously as the first captain you have to make sure some things don’t happen – to create that environment but what we’ve seen is a group of great characters. “That is what you need. My job now is to try to create that energy, that chemistry back as a group of captains – me, Rúben, Rodri, Erling – so people behave in the right way in training and in games, arrive on time to training, train properly, be in good condition, take care of themselves. That is our job.” Monaco lost their opening Champions League fixture 4-1 against Club Brugge and come into this game after being defeated 3-1 at Lorient. The head coach, Adi Hütter, will be without key personnel for City’s visit, which will force him to select a makeshift midfield. Despite the problems, they will not be able to call upon Paul Pogba who is still not fit enough to feature after joining for free in the summer, having served an 18-month doping ban. “We have to trust and believe that we are able to beat Man City, but for this we need an outstanding game in all directions, defensively, offensively,” Hütter said. “We have to suffer a lot, we have to fight together. Everything is possible in football.”"
‘We need to perform’: Eddie Howe calls for Newcastle reaction against Union SG,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/30/champions-league-eddie-howe-newcastle-union-saint-gilloise,"Eddie Howe has demanded his underachieving Newcastle players show their quality against the Belgian champions, Union Saint-Gilloise, in Brussels on Wednesday night. “This will be a good challenge at a time in the season when we need to perform,” Howe said. “It will be an important game in our Champions League journey – and a tough one.” Newcastle’s European odyssey began on a losing note at home against Barcelona two weeks ago amid a slow start to a season that has brought only one Premier League win. Howe’s players arrived here after the bruising 2-1 home defeat against Arsenal on Sunday with their manager demanding a response. “The Arsenal game should be a motivator not a hangover,” he said. “We need to use that as motivation.” Howe would not give an update on the knee injury that led to the England full-back Tino Livramento being carried off. Newcastle are seeking a specialist second opinion and the manager chose not to share the first consultant’s assessment. “That could be a mistake,” he said. “I’d rather wait.” On a more encouraging note, the central defender Fabian Schär has recovered from concussion to return to the squad for a meeting with a sleeping giant reawakened. Union SG – or Les Unionistes – won the Belgian league 11 times by 1935. It was 90 years until they triumphed again but now they have made it into the Champions League main draw for the first time. Newcastle analysts at PSV a fortnight ago saw Union SG canter past their Dutch hosts, winning 3-1 with the Canada striker Promise David among the visiting scorers. That performance in Eindhoven suggested Sébastien Pocognoli’s team have recovered from the loss of their key midfielder last season, Noah Sadiki, and the free-scoring striker Franjo Ivanovic to Sunderland and Benfica respectively in the summer. It is surely no coincidence that the art of selling and buying was seemingly perfected by Union SG in 2018. That was the year Tony Bloom, the Brighton owner, bought the then second-tier club. The need to comply with Uefa’s multiclub ownership rules dictates that Bloom is now a minority shareholder, but the player recruitment department continues to benefit from the data‑led scouting he introduced. Recent acquisitions include the former Brighton goalkeeper Kjell Scherpen, and visiting fans may also recognise Kevin Mac Allister, the older brother of Liverpool’s and Argentina’s Alexis, and Union SG’s captain, Christian Burgess, once of Portsmouth. The manager Pocognoli, too, is a familiar face for English audiences. The 38-year-old former Belgium left-back spent three seasons at West Brom from 2014 to 2017 and was loaned to Brighton in that time. As a coach Pocognoli, who is of Italian heritage, began making his name when managing Belgium Under-18s and, after turning Union SG into Belgian Pro League champions in his first season, is attracting admiring glances from some of Europe’s bigger clubs. For now he seems content at Union SG’s listed art deco Joseph Marien Stadium, situated in attractive parkland in the Brussels suburb of Forest. Unfortunately that atmospheric old ground holds only 9,400 and does not meet Uefa’s seating requirements, so Newcastle will be hosted at the 21,599-capacity Lotto Park, home of Union SG’s city rivals Anderlecht. Not that the venue change is likely to diminish the habitual vibrancy of a Union SG fanbase happy to mix sport and politics. The club’s supporters are known for their progressive and inclusive values and are no strangers to making stands against fascism and racism. Union SG’s unofficial motto is “Anti-fascist Unionist for life”. Pocognoli is excited to showcase the talents of a team unbeaten in the league but a little apprehensive of a Newcastle side that, despite losing Alexander Isak, has a £70m forward in Germany’s Nick Woltemade. “We’re ambitious,” the Union SG manager said. “But also realistic. I’m not going to put a percentage on our chances against Newcastle but I expect a very physical match. It’s a real challenge; I’m curious to see how we do.” Howe spoke of Woltemade’s “strong” start and described as “irrelevant” comments from Karl Heinz-Rummenigge, a supervisory board member at Bayern Munich, that Newcastle had been “idiots” to pay so much for Woltemade."
